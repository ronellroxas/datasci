She was actually quite polite and very calm. She was not diagnosed with any formal kind of psychiatric illness.\u201d Liu, a consultant at Castle Peak Hospital, said she interviewed the mother, now 30, on four more occasions, during which she reported suffering from a low mood as a result of stress from childcare and her first experience of managing such a large household. But the expert found these symptoms were not pervasive or severe enough to warrant a diagnosis, because they were reactive to stress and not as generalised as one would expect of depression, which affects the person as a whole, given its nature as a biological illness involving an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain. That finding was supported by the fact the mother did not require any medical attention in the three years between her arrest and trial, as well as a five-month record of more than 15,000 messages with her husband and a friend, which offered an insight into her overall mood and motivation to connect with others. In particular, Liu noted the mother\u2019s irritability and claim of impaired judgment was specifically directed to the deceased and her eight-year-old stepson, without any impact on her loving relationship with her husband and biological daughter, then aged seven. \u201cYou won\u2019t just be irritable towards two people,\u201d the prosecution witness said. \u201cThis is not mental illness, it\u2019s just human nature \u2013 and if it\u2019s human nature, it\u2019s an issue for the jury.\u201d The stepmother and the children\u2019s 29-year-old father have admitted to child cruelty inflicted upon the deceased and her brother over 150 days from August 10, 2017, but denied murdering the girl, who died of septicaemia on the following January 6. Prosecutors said the couple had indirectly but significantly contributed to the child\u2019s death because their prolonged abuse and neglect had considerably weakened her immune system and ability to fight the bacterial infection that ultimately killed her. The High Court heard both defendants had sought to plead guilty to manslaughter \u2013 a bid rejected by the prosecution \u2013 with the mother contending she was suffering from a recurrent depressive disorder at the material time. Liu\u2019s expert report revealed the stepmother\u2019s account of her childhood, from being a single child having a poor relationship with her father and experiencing her parents\u2019 divorce at about age 16, to being raped twice in her teenage years, going through an abortion with her then husband, and a divorce in 2015. The woman then met her current husband on WeChat in February 2016, moved in with his family the following September and tied the knot two months later. She also told the psychiatrist she had a bad relationship with her husband\u2019s family and it was decided that they should move in with her mother, which took place on August 10, 2017. A month later, she started to hit her stepchildren, first on their palms, then with a rattan stick on their buttocks and soles, because the boy told lies while the girl exhibited poor self-care and did not respond to her, the report said. She added that her husband was also involved in hitting the children, claiming he was responsible for 60 to 70 per cent of the beatings and that he was more forceful as he would also throw punches. She further admitted to the psychiatrist she had tied up the children to stop them from picking their scars, and had arranged for their absences to prevent the school from seeing the beating marks. On Thursday, her defence counsel Caesar Lo said her childhood experiences \u201cmight have sowed the seed for future psychological illness\u201d, and she was depressed at the material time, with symptoms such as sleeping problems, headaches, and feelings of helplessness and desperation, as reflected by her WeChat and WhatsApp messages. \u201cAt first I was truly fond of them,\u201d she texted her friend on December 5. \u201cNow I find them annoying from the bottom of my heart \u2026 I don\u2019t even want to talk to them. I\u2019m under a lot of stress.\u201d A week later she said: \u201cIt\u2019s better when the two elder ones return from school \u2013 once it\u2019s just the two of us, I really want to die. \u201cSometimes I see the injuries I couldn\u2019t bear it,\u201d she continued on December 11. \u201cBut once [the child] starts talking, making noises, nagging, I feel so much hate. But I don\u2019t think I would hit [the child] again, I\u2019ve [reached the point of] scaring myself, even when [the child] isn\u2019t afraid.\u201d Later she texted the same friend: \u201cI kind of want to strangle myself to death. The family of six can burn charcoal together. Quick and easy.\u201d The psychiatrist, however, maintained under cross-examination that these messages were not indicative of depression or adjustment disorder, as she found the mother was just expressing her emotions in a transient moment, without any actual plan to commit suicide. Liu added the woman had specifically denied having recurrent suicidal thoughts. The children\u2019s 56-year-old step-grandmother also denied four counts of child cruelty. None of the defendants or their relatives can be identified due to a gag order from Mr Justice Albert Wong Sung-hau, aimed at protecting the identities of the children.

The Civil Aeronautics Board on Tuesday capped passenger arrivals at Manila's international airport to a maximum of 1,500 per day from March 18 to April 19 to help contain the spread of COVID-19, which has infected 640,984 people in the Philippines. \u2014 With a report from Reuters"}, {"title": "Hiling ng NTF sa overseas Pinoys: Ipagpaliban muna paguwi sa gitna ng COVID-19 surge", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "date": "Mar 19 2021 01:02 PM", "content": "MAYNILA - Umapela ang tagapagsalita ng National Task Force on COVID-19 sa mga Pilipino abroad na nais umuwi sa bansa na ipagpaliban na muna ang kanilang plano para makatulong sa hakbang ng gobyerno na mapababa ang bilang ng mga kaso ng coronavirus sa Pilipinas. Ito'y matapos bawiin ng gobyerno ang kautusan na mga overseas Filipino workers lamang ang maaaring pumasok sa bansa sa loob ng isang buwan dahil sa pagsirit ng mga kaso. Sa paglilinaw Biyernes, sinabing lahat ng Pilipino mula ibang bansa ay maaari nang pumasok, pero hanggang 1,500 lang kada araw ang pwedeng tanggapin. \u201cSa mga Pilipinong pauwi, kung \u2018di na maiiwasan na kailangan kayong umuwi, 'yan po ay mapapasailalim na sa poder ng Commissioner of Immigration na maaring payagan o hindi basta sang-ayon doon sa mga lumabas na mga orders,\u201d sabi ni NTF spokesman Restituto Padilla. Sa panayam sa TeleRadyo nitong Biyernes, inabisuhan din niya ang mga papauwi sa bansa na mag-check din muna sa website ng Bureau of Immigration. \u201cMaganda po check niyo website ng Bureau of Immigration pero kung pwede pa kayong manatili kasama ang inyong anak at hindi naman kayo nagmamadaling umuwi, ang ating abiso ay ipagpaliban n\u2019yo na lang po 'yung pagbiyahe para makatulong sa ginagawa nating hakbang para mapigilan 'yung pagpasok ng new variants,\u201d sabi ni Padilla. Wala naman aniyang makakapigil sa mga Pilipinong nais na umuwi ng bansa basta\u2019t ito aniya ay naaayon sa ipinatutupad na protocols ng immigration. Pansamantalang isasara ng Pilipinas ang borders nito sa mga dayuhan simula Marso 22 hanggang Abril 21, bilang isa sa mga tugon sa biglang pagtaas ng bilang ng mga kaso ng COVID-19 at ang pagdami na rin ng impeksiyong dulot ng mga bagong variant. Sa ilalim ng kautusan, maaari namang pumasok ang mga seaman, kabilang ang mga dayuhan na may seafarer's visa. \"Ang panibagong revision doon sa unang inilabas na guidelines ay ang pagpapahintulot ngayon sa lahat ng mga maglalayag, Pilipino man o foreigner basta may hawak na seafarer's visa. Pwede na silang magpatuloy ng kanilang biyahe papuntang Pilipinas basta ito ay kasama sa kanilang gagawin na crew change na tinatawag sa green lane na protocol na ating isinaad at ginawa noong nakaraang taon para patuloy ang pagpapalitan ng mga tao, o crew ng isang barko,\u201d paliwanag niya. Naisama rin aniya sa revision ang exemption sa lahat ng mga asawa o anak ng mga Pilipino na kasama nilang bumibiyahe pabalik ng bansa basta mayroon silang valid visa. \u201cWala pa ring pagbabago sa foreign nationals. Nakalagay pa rin sa guidelines na maliban lang sa medical emergencies na endorso ng DFA at ng OWWA, wala pang foreign national na maaring pumunta dito maliban lang kung sila ay asawa o anak ng isang Pilipinong pabalik na po dito at may hawak na valid na visa,\u201d saad niya. Kasama din sa memo ang pagkakaroon ng 1,500 kada araw na limit para sa international inbound passengers sa Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Nitong Huwebes, nakapagtala ang Pilipinas ng kabuuang 640,984 na kaso ng COVID-19, kabilang na ang higit 66,000 active cases. \u201cAng pinakamainam na panangga natin sa pagkakaroon ng COVID-19 ay ang striktong pagsunod pa rin sa health protocols, maging nandito tayo sa Pilipinas, sa ibang bansa, o habang nagbibiyahe,\u201d sabi ni Padilla. - TeleRadyo 19 Marso 2021"}, {"title": "Doctors suspected Jan Catherine Sy was stricken by leptospirosis", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "date": "Mar 19 2021 12:56 PM", "content": "MANILA - Leptospirosis from bacterial infection was considered by doctors as the \"highest possibility\" for the illness of Henry Sy's 29-year-old granddaughter Jan Catherine prior to her sudden demise. The Sy family confirmed the death of Jan Catherine, daughter of Henry \"Big Boy\" Sy. Jr, on Thursday. Sy Jr. is chairman of SM Prime Holdings. COVID-19, hepatitis, dengue and malaria had been ruled out by doctors, the family said in a statement shared with relatives and friends when the young woman was still in critical condition in a hospital. \"They are still not sure what this is, but the highest possibility is that it is bacterial infection that resulted in leptospirosis. This is possible if even a small cut that can go unnoticed is made,\" they said. Sy's condition showed \"no signs of a disease\" or virus brewing. She was \"young and strong,\" the family had said. Before she passed away, Sy was put on 3 strong antibiotics to try to kill the bacteria, and she was also given steroids, the family shared. She was an equestrian who started competing locally at the age 13, according to an Inquirer interview where she also said that her horses were her \"top priority.\" She was scheduled to get married next month. Sy trained in France before joining the SM Development Corp in 2018. She used to be a project director for SM Development Corp. The Sy patriarch died in January 2019 at age 94. -- report from Mimi Ong, ABS-CBN News"}]
