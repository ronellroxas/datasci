Late-stage trial results showed the vaccine was 91.6 percent effective in preventing the disease, Food and Drug Administration director-general Eric Domingo told reporters in a press briefing. The efficacy rate of the vaccine, which comes in a 2-dose regimen administered 3 weeks apart, is consistent among all age groups 18 and older, he added. \"Based on the totality of evidence available to date, including data from adequate and well-known controlled trials, it is reasonable to believe that the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology Sputnik V Gam-Cov-Vac COVID-19 vaccine may be effective to prevent COVID-19,\" Domingo said. The potential benefits of the Sputnik V vaccine, he noted, also outweigh the known and potential risks of the Russian-developed shots. \"The adverse events reported were mostly mild and transient, similar to common vaccine reactions. No specific safety concerns were identified,\" Domingo said. The Philippines will start negotiating a supply deal for Sputnik doses next Tuesday, said vaccine \"czar\" Secretary Carlito Galvez. \"Ang initial request po namin is kung puwedeng makapag-deliver sila ng more or less 3 million doses this coming April, May,\" he said. (Our initial request is that they deliver more or less 3 million doses this coming April, May.) Authorities will also try to convince their Russian counterparts to allow Philippine local governments to procure Sputnik jabs, said Galvez. The Gamaleya Institute applied for emergency use of its experimental vaccine on Jan. 7. It later submitted results of its Phase 3 trials on Jan. 21. It marks the fourth vaccine to obtain regulatory approval in the Philippines after Pfizer-BioNTech on Jan. 14, AstraZeneca-Oxford on Jan. 28 and Sinovac on Feb. 22. Domingo said the Philippine Archipelago International Trading Corp. should supply the vaccine to emergency response stakeholders. The jabs, which are stored at -18 degree Celsius and below, shall be administered to healthy individuals aged 18 years and older. \"The good with the Sputnik V vaccine is that 25 percent of trial participants actually have comorbids [but] they also did quite well with the vaccine,\" he said. Domingo reiterated that the EUA was not a marketing authorization or a certificate of product registration. \"Hence, this EUA cannot be used as an authorization to market the vaccine commercially,\" he added. Russia approved the vaccine in August before its large-scale trial began, saying it was the first country to do so for a COVID-19 shot. It named it Sputnik V, in homage to the world\u2019s first satellite, launched by the Soviet Union. Small numbers of frontline health workers began receiving it soon after and a large-scale roll out started in December, though access was limited to those in specific professions, such as teachers, medical workers and journalists. In January, the vaccine was offered to all Russians. In February, Galvez said the Philippines was planning to buy 20 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. He had said the initial delivery of the vaccines was set in April if regulators authorized it for emergency use. The Philippines rolled out its COVID-19 inoculation drive on March 1, much later than other countries. To date, nearly 241,000 out of 1.7 million health-care workers have been vaccinated.

Once a state of emergency is declared, local government units are required to earmark funds to address the threat of the disease, Agriculture Assistant Secretary Noel Reyes told Teleradyo. It would also mandate concerned government agencies to address the problem, he added. The disease is harmless to humans but is deadly to pigs and there is no vaccine or cure. In a memorandum signed by Agriculture Secretary William Dar and submitted to Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, the agency on Wednesday drafted a proclamation to declare a state of emergency due to ASF. Dar said the disease had spread to 12 regions, 40 provinces, 466 cities and municipalities and 2,425 barangays. \"Over 3 million heads of pig have been lost due to the disease, causing contraction in pork supply and an unprecedented increase in the price of basic agricultural commodities,\" he said. The call came after a Senate panel recommended the declaration of state of emergency in the country due to the continuing threat of ASF. The DA has extended the implementation of price cap for pork and chicken until April 8 as the government continues to ease inflation. Duterte earlier issued an executive order imposing price cap on pork and chicken products in Metro Manila following public lament on the rising cost of these food items.

The DFA said in a Senate hearing on foreign relations that under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Philippines agreed to establish routes within its waters where foreign warships, submarines, aircraft can exercise non-suspendable navigation and overflights in their normal mode of operation \"without our consent.\" \"This is the compromise we made during the negotiations in the 3rd United Nations Conference on the Law of the Seas from 1973 to 1982 . . . in order for the archipelagos such as the Philippines to be treated as a single unit,\" said DFA Asec. Igor Bailen of the Office of Treaties and Legal Affairs. \"While UNCLOS allows user states to pass (through) archipelagic waters, it also provides the archipelagic state such as the Philippines right to designate only specific sea lanes where archipelagic sea lanes can be exercised.\" Bailen said that due to a lack of sea lanes, other countries are taking advantage of the situation every time their vessels pass through Philippine maritime waters. \"The routes normally used for international navigation has no precise definition under UNCLOS, and as such can be subject to varying interpretations by foreign countries in accordance to their own interests,\" said Bailen. \"In fact, this is exactly what China used to justify the passage of its warships over Sibutu passage between North Borneo and Sulu . . . therefore not designating ASLs (Archipelagic Sea Lanes) would allow foreign countries exercise archipelagic sea lanes passage in whatever route they consider or insist as routes normally used for international navigation,\" he emphasized. Under Senate Bill 1890, or \"An Act to Establish the archipelagic sea lanes in the Philippine Archipelagic waters,\" which is being pushed by Sen. Aquilino \u201cKoko\u201d Pimentel III, foreign ships and aircraft will be obligated to follow Philippine maritime rules, such as prohibition of lingering in the country's waters without force majeure or emergencies due to uncontrollable events. The DFA said Congress should handle the proposal to establish ASLs. Other groups have expressed their support for the proposition, including the UP Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea. \"This doesn't necessarily affect the merchant marine traffic, but at least the military marine traffic can then be more rationally addressed with our limited resources,\" said UP Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea director Jay Batongbacal. At present, the Philippines has territorial disputes with China over the Spratly group of islands in the West Philippine Sea. China has made a number of aggressive moves in the contested region, including construction of military bases and missile tests, in what experts call as attempts to undermine the Philippines\u2019 victory in a 2016 ruling on the South China Sea.

Nabigyan naman ang ibang evacuee ng emergency shelter pero nasira rin, kaya kariton na lang ang ginagamit ng mga gaya ni Josefina Cordon-Salan bilang pintuan ng kanilang tolda. \"Minsan 'pag [may] ulan, pinapasok kami,\" ani Cordon-Salan. Ngayong naka-alert level 2 ang Bulkang Taal, nanariwa ang pangamba ng mga evacuee. \"Hindi po ako makatulog, ang ginawa ko dito, nagmukmok ako. Dati hindi ako nagdasal, pero ngayon nagdasal ako. Ang buong katawan ko nanginginig,\" sabi ng evaucee na si Yolanda Rosaldo. Sa ngayon, kaniya-kaniyang diskarte sila para mairaos ang pangangailangan araw-araw, kagaya ng single mother na si Victoria Pronea na naglalako ng pagkain sa mga kapwa evacuee. \"Para lang sa aking mga anak, masuportahan ko lang sila,\" ani Pronea. Para dugtungan ang kanilang pantustos, nagdala ang ABS-CBN Sagip Kapamilya ng relief goods sa nasa higit 250 pamilyang nasa 3 evacuation center sa Talisay, Batangas. \"Malaking bagay kasi kung wala kaming pera, wala kaming pambili,\" ani Rosaldo.

May high blood at sakit sa puso ang 65 anyos na street sweeper na si Elvira Alojacin kaya hihingi muna siya ng payo sa doktor kung anong bakuna sa COVID-19 ang angkop sa kanya. \"Kung ikabubuti po naming mga senior, magpapabakuna po ako. Pero kung bawal po sa high blood, gaya ko, high blood po ako, hindi naman siguro ako pipilitin,\" sabi niya. Kalagitnaan ng Abril inaasahang magsisimula ang pagbabakuna sa mga Pilipinong edad 60 pataas. Pero sa Navotas City, nasa 2,000 pa lang o wala pang 10 porsyento ng 30,000 senior citizens ang nagpapalista para mabakunahan. \"Hindi sila masyadong techie, eh online po 'yung pagrehistro. At number 2, kahit mayroon tayong registration sa mga barangay, takot sila lumabas ngayon because doon sa surge ng COVID,\" ani Mayor Toby Tiangco. Magbabahay-bahay na ang mga tauhan ng Navotas LGU para irehistro ang mga senior citizen.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\nPinag-aaralan din nila kung puwedeng house-to-house ang diskarte sa pag-rollout ng bakuna sa seniors kung hindi pa rin bababa ang mga aktibong kaso sa Abril.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\nAng inaalala ni Tiangco, baka magpabagal lang ito sa trabaho dahil kailangan pang obserbahan nang 30 minuto ang matuturukan ng COVID-19 vaccine sakaling may side effect. Naglalaro naman sa 40 hanggang 45 percent ng halos 100,000 senior citizens sa Marikina City ang payag magpabakuna. Plano ng Marikina City na magkaroon ng libreng transportasyon na may pickup at drop-off points para sa mga magpapabakunang senior.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\nPag-aaralan din ang paglalagay ng satellite vaccination sites na mas accessible sa kanila, depende sa dami ng magpapabakuna.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\nAyon kay Marikina Mayor Marcelino Teodoro, dodoblehin ang dami ng mga doktor na naka-standby sa vaccination sites para sa senior citizen. Sa Quezon City, tuloy-tuloy din ang pagrerehistro ng mga gustong magpabakuna na senior citizens mula sa kabuuang 300,000. Nasa 4 milyon hanggang 9 milyong seniors ang target mabakunahan sa buong bansa. Nilinaw naman ni vaccine czar Carlito Galvez na sa ngayon, hindi pa pinapayagan pero pinag-aaralan ang paggamit ng bakuna ng Sinovac na CoronaVac sa senior citizens. \"We are not allowing... Maybe looking on future possibility of allowing since based on the study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group, out of 15 countries which are using Sinovac, 11 countries deployed them for their senior citizens,\" sabi ni Galvez.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\nSabi sa TeleRadyo ni Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, kailangan munang magpadala ng datos kung ano ang efficacy ng CoronaVac sa seniors. \"Dapat ang Sinovac magpapadala ng datos na magpapakitang malinaw na malinaw kung ano ang efficacy nito doon sa 60 years old and above,\" ani Duque. Samantala, sa kabila ng limitadong global supply ng COVID-19 vaccines, nananatiling positibo si Galvez na maaabot ng Pilipinas ang target na pagbakuna ng 70 mlyon para makamit ang herd immunity. \"We will have a better Christmas this coming year,\" sabi ni Galvez. \u2014Ulat ni Vivienne Gulla, ABS-CBN News"}, {"title": "Panukalang gawing lifetime ang passport validity ng senior citizens, isinusulong sa Senado", "author": "Jasmin Romero, ABS-CBN News", "date": "Mar 18 2021 09:13 PM", "content": "MAYNILA - Muling isinusulong ni Sen. Lito Lapid ang habambuhay na validity ng passport ng mga senior citizen. Sa virtual hearing nitong Huwebes ng Senate Committee on Foreign Relations na pinamumunuan ni Sen. Aquilino \u201cKoko\u201d Pimentel III, iginiit ni Lapid na kailangan ito ng mga senior citizen, lalo na't karamihan sa mga ito ay mahihina na. \"'Yung mga senior citizen natin, karamihan diyan ay \u2018di na makalakad, \u2018di na makakita, malabo na ang mata. Kaya, pwede na sigurong pagbigyan,\" giit ni Lapid na nagpanukala ng Senate Bill No. 1197. Naghain din ang senador ng parehong panukalang batas noong 2019. Pero kung tatanungin ang Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), mahirap daw itong gawin dahil hindi ito akma sa international standards. \u201cOur position is that the grant of the lifetime passport validity will not be compliant with the [International Civil Aviation Organization\u2019s] specifications,\u201d paliwanag ni DFA Office of Consular Affairs Executive Director Alnee Gamble. Dagdag ni Gamble, ang ICAO ay isang ahensya sa United Nations na naglalatag ng specifications para sa mga ini-isyu ng isang \u201cmachine readable travel document\u201d, gaya ng pasaporte ng Pilipinas. BALIKAN: Imbes umanong makatulong, baka lalo pa itong maka-perwisyo sa mga senior citizen. \u201cThe issue there is the passport will become non-compliant, because it does not conform with the ICAO standards, and our senior citizens will have a problem when they cross borders,\" giit niya. Hindi naman kuntento dito si Sen. Francis Tolentino. Aniya, baka pwede itong gawan ng paraan para mabawasan ang mga kailangang asikasuhin ng mga senior citizens. \u201cPerhaps, a method can be devised without violating our existing agreements, by just perhaps stamping or revalidating, in so far the 5 to 10 years requirement is concerned... We give respect and honor to our senior citizens by not burdening them administratively,\u201d aniya. \u201cin the short life span that they would have here on earth.. to outrightly suggest that what the good senator has done would be violative of the existing international regulations, is unfair,\u201d dagdag ng senador. Pero ayon sa DFA, kailangan pa ring sundin ang panuntunan ng ICAO. Kung hindi umubra ang lifetime validity, minungkahi ni Pimentel na gawing libre na lang ang renewal ng passport. Hindi naman ito sinang-ayunan ni Sen. Pia Cayetano. \"At 60 years old, so many of these people are quite young and probably travel 20 times a year, have the liberty of traveling and spending money. I don't see the point of making it free.. I have reservations for making it free just because they are of a certain age,\" paliwanag ni Cayetano.

The President said the government was not liable for a previous spate of killings in Negros Oriental, but he would claim responsibility for deaths from his order. \"Kung ako ang nagpapatay, sabihin ko sa inyo, 'Pinapatay ko \u2018yang p***** i**** \u2018yan kasi gago \u2018yan.

Noong isang taon, sinasabing nagkaroon na ng COVID-19 ang 47 taong gulang na health worker na may hypertension, diabetes, at bronchial asthma. Noong Pebrero 22, sumailalim ulit siya sa RT-PCR test kung saan positibo ang kaniyang resulta. Pero kinabukasan, Pebrero 23, nagpa-test ulit siya at lumabas na negatibo ang resulta. Marso 4 nang bakunahan ang naturang health worker ng Sinovac vaccine. Wala siyang sintomas ng kahit anong sakit noon. Makaraan ang 4 na araw, Marso 8, nalaman ng health worker na positibo siya ulit sa COVID-19. Na-admit siya sa ospital noong Marso 10 pero namatay makalipas ang 3 araw. Ayon kay Dr. Rommel Lobo ng NAEFIC, maaaring ang positibong resulta ng RT-PCR test noong Pebrero 22 ay remnants o latak lang ng coronavirus. Posible umanong nakuha ng health worker ang panibagong impeksiyon matapos mabakunahan. \"The patient might have been exposed to an individual she had encountered,\" ani Lobo. \"We know that there is certain period of incubation. She developed the symptom after vaccination. The vaccine does not have anything to do with the infection. The exposure is responsible for this,\" paliwanag ng doktor. Ayon naman kay Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo, naabisuhan na nila ang manufacturer ng bakuna ukol sa insidente. Naghihintay pa rin ang FDA ng impormasyon kung may katulad na pangyayari sa ibang bansa kung saan ipinamahagi ang Sinovac. Paalala naman ni Domingo: \"Kapag nabakunahan, hindi 'yan magic na biglang hindi na po kayo puwedeng magkaroon ng COVID. It takes time and you have to give your body time to develop immunity.\" Sa datos ng FDA, nasa higit 7,000 adverse events na ang naire-report sa kanila para sa bakuna ng Sinovac at AstraZeneca. Mas marami umano ang itinuturing na non-serious kompara sa serious adverse event. Maituturing na seryoso ang isang adverse event kung matapos mabakunahan ay namatay o nalagay sa alanganin ang buhay ng naturukan, kung kailangan maospital, kung nagkaroon ng disability, at kung nagdulot ng birth defect sa anak ng nabakunahang buntis. Ang malinaw sa ngayon, ayon sa Department of Health, hindi kailangang itigil ang pagbabakuna kontra COVID-19. \"The vaccine was not the one that caused the death of our health care worker,\" ani Dr. Beverly Ho ng DOH. Dahil sa patuloy na pagtaas ng kaso ng COVID-19, lalo sa National Capital Region (NCR), kasabay ng pautay-utay na rollout ng bakuna, iminungkahi ng OCTA Research Group na baka mas makatulong kung ang mga paparating na bakuna ay maipamahagi muna sa mga lugar na may pagdami ng mga kaso. \"While we understand that there is a need to prioritize our health workers, at the same time we are dealing right now with a serious surge in NCR and this is also occurring in parts of Calabarzon,\" ani Guido David ng OCTA Research Group. Ayon kay David, ang pagbabakuna sa malaking porsiyento ng mga nasa NCR ay magkakaroon pa rin ng positibong epekto sa bilang ng kaso sa iba pang rehiyon. Sa huling projection ng grupo, nakita nilang seryoso na ang surge ng kaso ng COVID-19 sa NCR. Sa 25 local government unit na may pinakamaraming naitalang kaso mula Marso 10 hanggang 16, 15 ay nasa NCR.

The three former officials have been vocal against President Rodrigo Duterte's policy on the South China Sea. \"The Filipino people deserve a better government,\u201d said Carpio, 1Sambayan Chairman, according to a statement of the group. \"1Sambayan believes coming together as one will prevent a repeat of the scenario in 2016, when a president won by a plurality but not a majority of votes,\" the group said. \"It is, then, just a matter of choosing that one candidate for each national position,\" it added. The group's convenors said they are looking to endorse a candidate who has a clean track record, an upright stand on key issues, platforms that address the country's current problems, \"recall among the voting population... and the verve to compete with other candidates for the people\u2019s votes.\" 1Sambayan said it would \"conduct their own online survey and take into account other surveys by reputable organizations to gauge the winnability of the aspiring candidates.\" The coalition\u2019s convenors will create a shortlist of possible candidates and \"thoroughly interview each aspirant and examine their eligibility and qualifications for office,\" the group's statement read. President Rodrigo Duterte's daughter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, and PDP-Laban acting president Manny Pacquiao would not be included in the shortlist, Del Rosario told reporters. The group 'rejects' candidates who are supportive of Duterte's authoritarian policies, he said, when asked if 1Sambayan would consider backing the two. \"The Filipino people should reject all those identified with dictatorship and authoritarianism, reject all those responsible for or who abet extrajudicial killings and whose mantra is 'kill, kill, kill,' and all those who violate human rights,\" he said. Duterte had said in 2018 that he had to be a \"dictator\" to put the country in order, and that his \u201conly sin\u201d was extrajudicial killings. Early this month, he also directed government troops to \"ignore\" human rights when they carry out his order to shoot dead armed communist rebels during encounters. Amid the criticisms, Duterte had been getting high approval and satisfaction ratings in surveys conducted by some pollsters, with a Pulse Asia survey in September last year showing that 91 percent of Filipinos approve of his performance in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. A Social Weather Stations survey in December 2019 also revealed that the administration scored an \"excellent\" or net satisfaction rating of +73 at the time. During the 2019 mid-term elections, nine senatorial candidates endorsed by Duterte and three independents won. None from the opposition slate made it. DUTERTE-CARPIO AND PACQUIAO REACTIONS Duterte-Carpio, who had repeatedly stated she is not running for the Presidency in 2022, slammed 1Sambayan's statement, saying the coalition is sowing disunity. \"They claim to be a coalition of democratic forces but they reject so many who do not agree with them. They sound authoritarian to me,\" said the chair of the regional alliance Hugpong ng Pagbabago. \"Kung gusto nila maging successful, dapat ang panawagan nila ay magkaisa. What this country needs is unity, not messages with the word reject,\" she said. (If they want to be successful, they should call for unity. What this country needs is unity, not messages with the word reject.) Pacquiao, for his part, stuck with his recent pronouncements as he reiterated that \"this is not the best time to talk about these political line-ups.\" Some members of the ruling political party have signed a resolution earlier this month asking Duterte to run for Vice President in 2022, a move Pacquiao declared to be illegitimate. Last week, Duterte said his longtime aide, Sen. Christopher \"Bong\" Go, had told him of his desire to be President. The lawmaker said it was just a joke, but he said he might change his mind if Duterte decides to run for Vice President. Meanwhile, political analyst Ramon Casiple said 1Sambayan's launch has signaled the start of the \"election season\" heading to the 2022 polls. He said that even if the group has yet to name its candidates it is clear with its intent to meet head on any candidate the administration might field. \"Political people na ito, kahit sabihin a Supreme Court justice sila before, the fact na lumitaw sila sa ganyang context... naghihintay na ako d'yan na may sasabihin silang pangalan ng kandidato later. Yung iba dyan may bibira sa kanila, hindi maiiwasan yan e. Season na,\" said Casiple. \"Ang eleksyon natin isang taon iyan. Napapanahon na para simulan na magusap usap para sa pulitika.\" When asked what 1Sambayan must do to succeed against an administration-backed candidate, Casiple said it should field only one presidential bet. \"Dapat isang kandidato lang. Kasi kung sila sila maghiwahiwalay. Sigurado magkakaproblema agad. Kung isa lang ang kalaban ng administrasyon, mas malaki ang tsansa,\" he said. - with reports from Katrina Domingo and RG Cruz, ABS-CBN News RELATED VIDEO"}, {"title": "Bilang ng COVID-19 cases sa Calabarzon nakitaan ng pagtaas", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "date": "Mar 18 2021 07:59 PM", "content": "Bukod sa Metro Manila, ilang lugar din sa Calabarzon region ang nakitaan din ng pagtaas sa mga kaso ng COVID-19 ng OCTA Research Group.

Sa bagong guidelines na inilabas ng pandemic task force ng bansa, tanging mga OFW lang muna ang papapasukin sa Pilipinas mula Marso 18 hanggang Abril 19. Nasa 1,500 kada araw lang mula sa dating 3,000 ang papapasukin para hindi agad mapuno ang mga pinagdadalhan sa kanila na mga quarantine facility. Sakaling sumobra sa 1,500 ang bilang ng mga papasok na pasahero, airlines na ang mananagot o magmumulta. Sabi ni Senate labor committee chairman Sen. Joel Villanueva, ang paglalagay ng limitasyon ay tila pag-amin umano ng gobyerno na hindi gumagana ang quarantine, testing at contact tracing program nito. \"Parang limang Airbus 350 lang ang gusto nating lumapag sa NAIA kada araw. Parang ang gusto nating mangyari ay padaanin sa imbudo ang ating mga kababayan. 'Yun pong mga naipit sa lockdown dito sa atin, ilang araw lang na hindi makauwi sa bahay nila, balisang-balisa na. Paano pa 'yung nasa ibang bansa ka?\" ani Villanueva sa pagdinig ng Senado ukol sa panukalang pagtatatag ng Department of Overseas Filipinos o DOFIL. \"Ang importante po ay testing, quarantine, at pag-aralan kung paano pa mapapalaki ang available na pondo ng OWWA (Overseas Workers Welfare Administration),\" dagdag ng senador. Sinabi ni OWWA Administrator Hans Leo Cacdac nitong Huwebes ng umaga na hihingi sila ng supplemental budget para sa repatriation ng mga OFW. Nasa P9.5 bilyon ang kanilang request na dagdag-pondo. Nabuo ang computation na ito mula sa average na 2,000 OFW na umuuwi araw-araw, o 60,000 sa isang buwan. Kasama sa budget ang gastos sa hotel accommodation na nasa 7 hanggang 9 araw at maximum rate na P3,000 kada gabi. Kaya suhestiyon ng mga senador, gamitin ang contingency fund ng OWWA sa halip na naghahagilap sila ng pondo para sa repatriation sa susunod na 8 buwan. Pero sabi ng Department of Budget and Management, hindi puwedeng galawin ang mga contingency fund dahil nakalaan ito sakaling kailanganin ng bagong bubuuing department. Sagot naman ni Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, ang repatriation ang top priority ng gobyerno at isang opsiyon lamang ang pagpondo sa DOFIL mula sa contingency fund. \"We will not reserve the contingency fund for the creation of the department, that's very clear in the bill,\" aniya. Banggit pa niya, pag-uusapan ngayon ang solusyun sa problema. 'MALAKING NEGATIBONG EPEKTO' Sa panayam sa Teleradyo, ibinahagi ni Villanueva ang pagkadismaya sa desisyon na ito ng gobyerno dahil malaki daw ang negatibong epekto nito sa mga OFW na gustong umuwi sa bansa. Aniya, sabik umuwi ang mga OFW, at buwan nila itong pinlano sa kabila ng pandemya pero baka maharang lang sila sa airport. \"Napakalaking negative effect... 'Yung ating mga kababayan, salat sa pananalapi 'yan. Talagang hard-earned money po talaga yan... 'pag magbu-book 'yan, about 6 months to 1 year ang preparation niyan 'pag kukuha ng off 'yan sa trabaho. Then all of a sudden, eto, bawal na hindi ka na makakapunta,\" paliwanag niya. Nababahala rin ang senador dahil baka maging apektado na rin ang pagpapauwi sa mga itinuturing na \"distressed\" returning OFWs bunsod ng naturang polisiya. \"To be determined by DFA and OWWA, wala pa pong kinalaman kung paano ipa-prioritize 'yon ng DFA and OWWA. Lahat naman ng umuuwi [na OFWs] ngayong pandemya distressed po yan, paano yan ipa-prioritize?\" aniya. \"It's a bad taste in the mouth na sabihan natin ang mga bagong bayani na 'sige padala na lang kayo pero sasalain namin nang husto kung sino lang ang puwedeng umuwi fito sa inyong bayan na sinilangan.'\" \u2014 May ulat ni Robert Mano, ABS-CBN News RELATED VIDEO: "}, {"title": "DFA: 13 more Filipinos abroad infected with COVID-19, no new deaths recorded", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "date": "Mar 18 2021 06:57 PM", "content": "MANILA - The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Thursday recorded 13 more Filipinos infected with COVID-19 abroad, bringing the total number of confirmed cases among Pinoys outside the country to 15,941.

Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan and his crew landed in the Philippines on March 16, 1521, in the first circumnavigation of the world. He died on the shores of Mactan, Cebu, in a battle with chieftain Lapu-Lapu, which Duterte called \"an exemplary display of firm leadership and extraordinary courage defeated and drove away the colonials.\" Duterte said \"history should make us reflect on the past and look beyond our future.\" \"I therefore call on our kababayans to appreciate our rich history and learn from the experience of those that came before us so that we may never again allow any other tribe to compromise our sovereignty,\" the President said. Duterte led the unveiling of a marker in Guiuan, Samar for the 500th anniversary of Magellan's global voyage. Some historical accounts say he first landed in Homonhon, an island in Guiuan. \"We thank everybody, the ancestors of the Spaniards who came here.

After Magellan's death, further Spanish expeditions ended in disaster before Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi established the first permanent Spanish settlement in Cebu in 1565. Colonizers eventually converted most of the country to Roman Catholicism, except for the Moros of Mindanao. Duterte, the first President from Mindanao, rejected in 2019 a celebration for Magellan\u2019s arrival, which he said heralded 300 years of Spanish rule and abuse against Filipinos. \"You know they came to our country as imperialist.

The World Health Organization said that while it noted the temporary suspension on the use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in some countries in the European Union as a precautionary measure based on reports of rare blood coagulation disorders in persons who had received it, the international body still recommends that vaccinations continue as it considers that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. Domingo said the FDA receives reports of suspected side effects daily. Minor side effects must be reported within a week, while the serious ones must be relayed to them or the AEFI committee within 24 hours, he said. Both Domingo and Lobo reminded the public that even after vaccination, those inoculated should still follow health protocols since vaccine protection is not 100% and it takes time for the body to produce antibodies. \"'Pag po kayo nabakunahan, 'di ka pa magkakaroon ng protection at immunity from COVID-19.

The Boracay Inter-Agency Task Force approved the cheaper and non-invasive coronavirus test, which is currently being offered only by the Philippine Red Cross, as alternative to the nasopharyngeal swab RTPCR test. The Department of Tourism welcomed the task force's decision and said it is also willing \"to support funding for an RTPCR or gene expert machine\" as the Malay town government may propose. The DOT also recommended to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases to allow persons below 15 and above 65 years old with a valid plane ticket to travel to Boracay since the island is under modified general community quarantine (MGCQ). On Wednesday, the National Task Force Against COVID-19 said that that minors are allowed to travel domestically with their families even amid a surge in new infections. \"The NTF allows minors to travel with their families point to point. The only restriction is their movement within Metro Manila specially to malls and crowded areas consistent with the announcement of the MMDA,\" Ret. Gen.

The Philippine government had already announced that it would continue using the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, one of the only two vaccines currently available in the country. The country has so far received 525,600 doses from AstraZeneca and 600,000 doses from Sinovac. Duque previously said that the company has not seen any evidence linking the vaccine to reports of blood clotting. \"A careful review of all available safety data of more than 17 million people vaccinated in the European Union and UK with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis or thrombocytopenia, in any defined age group, gender, batch or in any particular country,\" the company said in a statement issued over the weekend. Countries like Ireland, Denmark, Norway and Iceland have suspended the use of the vaccine as they probe deaths reportedly due to coagulation disorders. Besides the doses from the COVAX Facility that arrived in the country, the private sector and local government units also ordered 17 million doses from AstraZeneca. An initial batch of 2.6 millions is expected to arrive in May, according to presidential adviser for entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion. AstraZeneca is one of the three companies with emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines. The other two are Sinovac and Pfizer. As of March 17, more than 70,000 health workers have been inoculated with AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine. The FDA said there were 3,769 suspected adverse events reported by those who received the jabs, representing 5.19% of those vaccinated. FDA Director General Eric Domingo said this is within the expected range since clinical trials often monitor up to 30% reports of adverse events. Most of the reported reactions are body pain, fever, headache, nasal congestion and other common vaccine side effects.

Roque said he was at a hotel in San Juan being used as an isolation facility. Asked to address rumors that he was staying instead at the presidential suite of a pricey hotel in Pasay, he said, \"That is fake news.\" \"Iyong tsinitsimis po na nandoon ako sa (the rumors that I am in) Pasay, I do not even know if we have the means to pay for that hotel,\" he said in a press briefing.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\"Masyadong grabe po 'yan, 7-star hotel po 'yan.

These establishments are different from the hotels used for the quarantine of returning Filipino migrant workers, he said. Roque earlier said he was asymptomatic. He said he was consulting his doctor if it would be better to go home because he has noticed that other people staying at his hotel seemed to have symptoms. He said he has helped several people get accommodations at the hotel where he was staying, including a director from his office, a broadcaster on the government television network, and an undersecretary of a line department. \"The rooms are fast being occupied, and I understand we're also in full capacity,\" Roque said.

In a statement released Wednesday, Cabral said, \"We are not back to square one. We are ten steps back from square one,\" as she recalled the challenges, especially of the health sector, when the country first confronted the pandemic. The Philippines is facing a surge in coronavirus cases and hospitals are under strain again, Cabral said. The Philippine economy also posted a -9.5 percent growth last year, its deepest slump since 1947. Officials and analysts attribute the current surge in COVID-19 cases to increased mobility of people, non-compliance with health protocols, and the presence of more transmissible COVID-19 variants. Some local governments, including in Metro Manila, have since revived some restrictive measures, including imposition of curfew. Foreigners and non-OFWs will also be temporarily barred from entering the country starting March 20 to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Cabral, who served as health chief during the the term of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, lamented the government's response to COVID-19 had been slow. \"Sana ay mas naging mabilis ang response natin at mas malawak. Palagay ko ay 'yan ang naging problema natin,\" she told TeleRadyo. (We could have been faster in our response, and covered more. I think that was our problem.) \"Marami tayong kakulangan sa contact tracing, border control at ngayon ay sa vaccine rollout,\" she added, even as Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said last week that the government showed \"excellent\" management of the COVID-19 pandemic. (We have deficiency in terms of contact tracing, border control and now, the vaccine rollout.) The country launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive on March 1, much later than many other countries, a day after Sinovac doses donated by China arrived in Manila. To date, over 240,000 anti-coronavirus jabs have reached the arms of healthcare workers. The Philippines aims to vaccinate all of its 1.7 million medical frontliners by April, according to vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. \"Assuming that there is a steady supply of vaccines, 'pag ang speed ng vaccination ay katulad ngayon (if the speed of the vaccination is the same as now), it will take us more than 12 years bago matapos 'yong 70 million (before we finished the 70 million),\" Cabral said. She said the government has to speed up the inoculation by 17 times to vaccinate two-thirds of the population by year-end. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III recently said Wednesday that the government aims to vaccinate daily some 450,000 against COVID-19 by next month as additional shots are expected to arrive. As regards contact tracing, Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said Thursday that the country's capacity remains strong, having 255,854 tracers, \"which is more than sufficient for the country's needs.\" According to the Department of the Interior and Local Government, there are 29,611 contact tracing teams nationwide, each composed of the municipal/city health officer and members of the Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams, volunteers from Civil Society Organizations, and augmentation from the DILG. Additional contact tracers have been deployed in Metro Manila amid the spike in new cases, said Malaya. Asked if her remark is harsh to government, Cabral, said: \"'Yan ang palagi kong sinasabi sa mga kasama ko sa DOH dati (This is what I always say to my colleagues before in DOH). I know you are doing your best. You have to do more than your best, because it's not good enough at this point.\" During his March 8 briefing, ahead of the first anniversary of the imposition of community quarantine in the country, Roque said the Philippines was able to control the spread of the disease and knows how to prevent deaths. The country on Wednesday recorded 4,387 coronavirus infections, the sixth straight day that newly-confirmed cases exceeded 4,000, pushing the total to 635,698. COVID-19-related fatalities stood at 12,866.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday unanimously scrapped the petitions challenging Duterte's withdrawal from the ICC, for being \"moot and academic.\" This decision recognizes that Duterte is the chief architect of foreign policy, said his spokesman Harry Roque. \"Dahil dito nanawagan kami sa ICC na huwag nang magsayang ng panahon sa kanilang mga imbestigasyon dahil hindi kinikilala ng Pilipinas ang hurisdiksyon ng ICC,\" he said in a press briefing. \"Patunay rin ito na gumagana ang ating mga prosesong legal kaya tama lamang na tigilan na ang pakikialam ng ICC sa ating domestic affairs,\" he added.

ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda in December found \"reasonable basis\" to believe that Duterte's war on drugs has spawned crimes against humanity. In turn, Roque and Duterte's chief legal counsel Salvador Panelo accused the prosecutor of politicking. Bensouda's office opened in February 2018 a preliminary probe into the slay of thousands of suspected drug users and peddlers in the Philippines, including those killed for allegedly resisting arrest or were allegedly gunned down by law enforcers disguised as vigilantes.\r\n\u00a0\r\nShe said she found \"reasonable basis to believe\" that crimes against humanity such as murder, torture and the infliction of serious physical injury and mental harm were committed under the drug war from July 2016 to mid-March 2019. She said the COVID-19 pandemic and \"capacity constraints\" delayed her office's goal to conclude its preliminary examination of Duterte's drug war. Duterte and his aides have repeatedly denied rights violations in the drug war, saying drug suspects were killed because they resisted arrest. He also repeated his accusation that rights defenders are \"preoccupied\" with the life of criminals, his advice for law enforcers to shoot suspects who fight back, and his promise to take responsibility for deaths in operations. Government data showed about 5,000 have died in anti-drug operations. Various rights groups are saying though that thousands more have been slain in alleged extrajudicial killings.

The health worker, a 47-year-old woman who had COVID-19 in 2020, was vaccinated with Sinovac\u2019s CoronaVac vaccine on March 4. According to the National Adverse Events Following Immunization Committee (NAEFIC), her comorbidities were diabetes, hypertension and bronchial asthma. Dr. Rommel Lobo, vice chair of the NAEFIC, said the woman tested positive again for COVID-19 through a PCR test on February 22 but tested negative the day after. Because of this, the positive test on February 22 was deemed remnants of her infection last year. Lobo said the woman did not have any symptoms when she was vaccinated on March 4. But on March 8, she tested positive for COVID-19. \"She was advised admission but she refused,\u201d he said. On March 10, the health worker was admitted to the hospital. \u201cUnfortunately she died on March 13 of COVID-19 infection,\u201d Lobo said.

Lobo said it was not a problem for the health worker since she was infected last year and it had already been at least 6 months. \u201cThe patient might have been exposed to an individual she had encountered and then she might be incubating or having asymptomatic symptoms at the time that she was vaccinated,\u201d Lobo said. In a separate phone interview with ABS-CBN News, Lobo said the woman might have gotten sick from a different strain, which was why she was re-infected even after surviving COVID the year before.

We are asking them for information if there are similar cases that happened in other countries,\u201d he said, adding that he does not consider the case unusual. While there are still no vaccines proven to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, Domingo reminded the public that it takes time for antibodies to develop after being vaccinated. \u201cAng lagi nating paalala, pag kayo ay nabakunahan hindi po iyon magic na biglang hindi na po kayo magkaroon ng COVID (We always remind people that after you are vaccinate it\u2019s not like magic that you will no longer have COVID). It takes time. You have to give your body time to develop immunity and resistance against the COVID-19 virus after a vaccine is injected into your body,\u201d he said. Lobo said this is why even for those vaccinated with 2 doses, they should still continue to follow physical distancing measures and other health protocols like wearing of face masks. \u201cRemember the vaccines are not 100% protective,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a certain percentage it may not protect you.

Kit Belmonte and Makabayan lawmakers on Tuesday filed House Resolution 1657 urging the lower house of Congress to condemn and investigate police's profiling of lawyers defending red-tagged individuals.

Fernando Calabria, Jr., the intelligence chief of the Calbayog Police Station, asked the Office of the Clerk of Court in Calbayog Regional Trial Court for a list of lawyers who represent \u201cCTG personalities in court.\u201d No reason was cited for the request but the letter drew widespread condemnation because attached to it was a table with a heading in one column captioned \u201cmode of neutralization.\u201d Police have used the term \u201cneutralization\u201d in police reports on drug cases to refer to killings, as pointed out by the June 2020 report of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.

According to a study by the Free Legal Assistance Group, more lawyers were killed during the administration so far of President Rodrigo Duterte than under previous presidents since dictator Ferdinand Marcos combined.

Namataan kasi noong Martes sa bahagi ng EDSA ang tarpaulin na may mukha ni Mandaluyong Regional Trial Court judge Monique Quisumbing-Ignacio. Si Quisumbing-Ignacio ang nagbasura sa kasong illegal possession of firearms and explosives laban sa mamamahayag na si Lady Ann Salem at unyonistang si Rodrigo Esparago dahil walang bisa ang search warrant na ginamit laban sa kanila. Sa taurpalin, pinasasalamatan siya dahil sa mabilis umanong paglaya ng kanila umanong kasamahan na sina Salem at Esparago. Kasama sa tarpaulin ang mga logo ng Communist Party of the Philippines, New Peoples\u2019 Army at National Democratic Front. Agad kinondena ni Bayan Muna Rep. Ferdinand Gaite ang aniya\u2019y pag-atake sa mga korte at pangha-harass sa mga huwes. \"The courts are under attack! After PNP's attempt to profile HR (human rights) lawyers, now we're seeing harassment vs. judges who expose their flawed searches!\" sabi ni Gaite. Puna ni Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate, marami raw talagang budget ang mga red tagger, sabay pagkondena sa tarpaulin na inilalagay umano sa kapahamakan ang seguridad ng hukom. Kabi-kabila rin ang mga batikos mula mga grupong Bayan Muna, Kapatid, Public Interest Law Center at maging sa Commission on Human Rights. \"We stress that members of the legal profession, such as lawyers and judges, are crucial in preserving constitutional rights, such as the right to an independent counsel; right to defend oneself in court; and right to speedy, public, and impartial trial among others,\" ani CHR spokesperson Jacqueline de Guia. Hiling ni Bayan Muna party-list chairman Neri Colmenares sa Korte Suprema, siguruhing maproteksyunan ang mga huwes gaya ni Quisumbing-Ignacio. \"We urge the Chief Justice to assure these judges, including Bacolod judge Ana Celeste Bernad who, like judge Ignacio, also voided judge Villavert\u2019s warrants, of the Supreme Court\u2019s protection in the performance of their function,\" ani Colmenares. Sumulat din sa SC ang mga propesor mula sa University of the Philippines College of Law para hilinging bumuo ng special committee to protect lawyers ang korte, kasunod ng paglabas ng sulat mula sa PNP na humihingi mula sa isang korte sa Calbayog ng listahan ng mga abogadong kumakatawan sa mga umano\u2019y \"communist-terrorist groups.\" Para sa mga propesor, malinaw itong pananakot sa mga aogado na maaaring mauwi sa pagkakait sa mga inaakusahang \"komunista at terorista\" sa kanilang karapatang maipagtanggol ng mga abogado. Pero nangako si PNP OIC Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar na handa ang kapulisan na magbigay ng tulong sa mga abogado, fiscal at huwes na nasa panganib dala ng kanilang tungkulin. Sa tala ng National Union of Peoples\u2019 Lawyers, 54 na abogado na ang napapatay sa ilalim ng administrasyong Duterte habang 61 naman ang bilang ng Free Legal Assistance Group, higit pa sa pinagsamang bilang ng mga napatay na abogado sa nakalipas na 6 na presidente. Sa isang joint statement, sinabi ng Philippine National Police at Integrated Bar of the Philippines na iimbestigahan ang lahat ng mga pagpatay sa mga abogado at lilitisin ang mga sangkot dito. Ang tumitinding red tagging sa mga aktibista, abogado at ilang personalidad sa oposisyon ang isa sa nakikitang nakakaalarmang mga pangyayari sa bansa sa nakalipas na mga buwan, base sa pag-aaral ng grupong Investigate PH na binubuo ng mga abogado at faith-based groups mula sa iba\u2019t ibang bansa. Habang nagpapatuloy ang mga pagpatay sa ilalim ng war on drugs, lalo umanong nagkaroon ng mga human rights violations sa pagpasa ng Anti-Terrorism Act at pagbuo ng grupong national task force to end local communist armed conflict o ntf-elcac na aktibo umano sa pangrered-tag sa iba\u2019t ibang grupo. \"Most individuals don't even know they are violating Anti-Terrorism Act because of vagueness of it... We really see this being an instrument to silence political opponents. Silence those trying to do their jobs, journalists, human rights defenders,\" ani Suzanne Adely, high level commissioner ng grupo. Dagdag pa rito ang kawalan umano ng gumaganang paraan para makamit ang hustisya sa mga pang-aabuso. Isusumite ng grupo ang kanilang report sa UN Human Rights Council at International Criminal Court. Wala pa tugon ang panig ng National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict sa isyu.

William Dar,\u201d DA Undersecretary William Medrano told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo. (We believe that the alleged tongpats system does not exist in the DA, especially under Sec. William Dar's leadership.) Medrano said Dar created a fact-finding committee to find out whether the racket exists or not, noting that it was their first time hearing about the alleged scheme. In a statement, the DA said its legal service chief is heading the committee, which will base its inquiry on the initial findings of the DA-Minimum Access Volume (MAV) Secretariat. \u201cWhile we stand firm that the issuance of MAV in-quota allocation is above-board and non-discretionary, we have created a special committee to look into allegations made by a lawmaker that there is a syndicate in the DA engaged in a payoff scheme,\u201d Dar said in the statement. \u201cNasabi din ni Sen.

Lacson earlier this week alleged that a syndicate in the agriculture department would collect P5 to P7 for every kilo of the 400,000 metric tons of pork that will be imported in the proposal to increase the minimum access volume (MAV). This is equivalent to P6 billion in kickbacks, he said.

Therefore, no one has benefited yet from the supposed P6 billion.) Malaca\u00f1ang had said President Rodrigo Duterte would look into the matter, and that he still trusts Dar. A month ago, Dar said his agency already submitted to Malaca\u00f1ang its recommendation to increase the MAV on pork imports to raise the country's stock following supply woes caused by the African swine fever outbreak in the country. \u201cWe would like to emphasize that our objective in increasing the MAV and reducing tariff is to stabilize supply and price of pork,\u201d the DA chief said Wednesday."}, {"title": "PTV nag-sorry sa #DutertePalpak tweet", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "date": "Mar 17 2021 09:15 PM", "content": "Humingi ng paumanhin ngayong Miyerkoles ang People's Television Network (PTV) matapos magamit ang hashtag na #DutertePalpak sa isang post nito sa kanilang opisyal na Twitter account.

The group, composed of university professors, noted that the capital region, which around a year ago was the first to be placed on community quarantine to stem the spread of the coronavirus, posted a 78 percent increase in new cases on Tuesday compared to a week ago. \u201cThe reproduction number in NCR increased to Rt = 1.96, its highest level since May 2020,\u201d the OCTA Group said in its latest report. A reproduction number or R naught of more than 1 means that the infection is spreading to more people since one infected person can pass the virus to one or more individuals. A reproduction number of 2 means 2 people can be infected by one COVID-19 patient. Officials and analysts have attributed the recent spike in new cases to the increased mobility of people, non-compliance with health protocols, and the presence of more transmissible COVID-19 variants. Besides being classified as high risk based on its daily attack rate of 15.9 per 100,000 of the population, Metro Manila has reached 64 percent occupancy in terms of COVID-dedicated ICU beds, the research group said. Among local government units, Pasay, Makati, Navotas and Santiago City in Isabela had \u201cvery high\u201d attack rates, which measure the proportion of the population infected with the COVID-19 virus. According to the OCTA Group, Santiago City had 1 reported case for the week of March 3-9, which increased to 244 for the week of March 10-16. Cases are also rising in Bacoor, Imus and Dasmari\u00f1as in Cavite, and in Antipolo City and Cainta in Rizal, all just outside Metro Manila, it said. Among local government units, the OCTA Group said Pasay, Makati, Navotas and Santiago, Isabela had \u201cvery high\u201d attack rates. The attack rate if the proportion of the population infected by COVID-19. @ABSCBNNews pic.twitter.com/8Xu1zkSY6r  POSSIBLE DECLINE? The OCTA Group said that while Caloocan, Marikina and Mandaluyong had \u201cvery rapid increases\u201d in cases, \u201cPasay, Malabon and Navotas experienced a slowing down as shown by lower percent increases in new COVID-19 cases compared to the previous week.\u201d \u201cThis could be a good sign moving forward,\u201d it said. Cebu City also had a \u201cnearly flat\u201d trend while new cases decreased by an average of 18% in Mandaue and Lapu Lapu cities, all in Region 7. With these observations and the ongoing measures being implemented by LGUs, the OCTA Group said its earlier projections of new cases, particularly in Metro Manila, may go lower. As early as March 1, the group already flagged the rising number of fresh infections in some parts of Metro Manila and warned that the country's total cases may reach 665,000 by the end of the month if the trend continues. \u201cAs the NCR deals with a COVID-19 surge, we need to assess the effects of efforts by the local governments in dealing with the surge in their respective cities. The localized lockdowns in Pasay and Navotas have helped reduce the reproduction number (or infection rate of the virus) from Rt = 2.4 to 1.8,\u201d the group said in its report on Wednesday. While the rate is still above 1, it shows that localized lockdowns \u201cwork to some extent\u201d, it added. \u201cTogether with reduced mobility, curfews, stricter implementation of health protocols and city ordinances, this can help reduce the reproduction number in NCR to more manageable levels.\u201d From a projection of 7,500 daily cases by the end of the month if the current trend continues, the OCTA group said Metro Manila may see less than 4,000 cases if the \u201cmore optimistic scenario\u201d of having effective localized measures will prevail. It also projects only 6,000 cases daily instead of 16,000 by mid-April, if the interventions are sustained in the region that accounts for a third of the country's economy. \"We simulated the combined effects of localized lockdowns, curfews and stricter implementation of health protocols. This projection paints a more optimistic scenario,\" the group said. It said the \u201ccombined efforts of the local governments and the citizens will further reduce the transmission rate and lower the reproduction number in NCR. If this happens, we will hopefully see fewer COVID-19 daily cases in the NCR.\" On top of localized lockdowns, which it said should be \u201chumane and protective of individual rights,\u201d expanded testing, contact tracing and \u201csupported isolation\u201d should also be done, the group said. The total number of COVID-19 cases in the country reached 635,698 on Wednesday after 6 days of more than 4,000 new cases. The Department of Health admitted that the current level of new cases is already at the same peak level as July last year. The country launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive on March 1, prioritizing health workers. It aims to inoculate up to 70 million to achieve herd immunity against the coronavirus. The Philippines' first COVID-19 case was confirmed on Jan. 30 last year in a Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan City, China where the disease is believed to have first emerged.

Pero may paliwanag ang mga pulis. \"Considering the restrictions of the pandemic ngayon napakahirap kumuha ng court order . . .

Lumalabas sa mga text message ni Decena na hindi nagpakita sa Commonwealth ang dealer na si Tan pero ang dumating umano ay ang tao niyang si alyas Bato na isa namang asset ng PDEA.

Kaya naman sa pagtataya ni Galvez, na tumatayong vaccine czar, aabutin ng Abril ang pagbibigay ng unang dose ng bakuna sa lahat ng health workers. Unang nabanggit ni Galvez na ngayong Marso matatapos ang pagbabakuna sa health workers. \"Talagang medyo binabagalan natin ng kaunti dahil \u2018yung napag-usapan po natin na mayroon adverse effects. Sa ngayon mayroon tayong accommodated na more or less 5,000 adverse effects, pero mga normal lang po, mga lagnat, parang lalagnatin,\" ani Galvez. Nasa 1,125,600 COVID-19 vaccine doses lang din ang kasalukuyang nasa bansa at nadala na sa implementing sites. Pero may mga pribadong ospital pa na hindi nakakatanggap ng alokasyon, ayon sa grupong Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines. \"Parang miscommunication with the DOH and these hospitals. Supposedly the hospitals were to submit requirements. Noong nag-inquire kami sa region, sabi dito n\u2019yo dapat ipinapadala, hindi sa national office. So we have to again resend,\u201d ani PHAPI President Dr. Jose Rene De Grano. Sa kasaluyang suplay ng bakuna sa bansa, higit 500,000 health workers lang ang mababakunahan. Pawang mga bakuna ng Sinovac at Astrazeneca sa ngayon ang itinuturok sa mga health workers. Inirekomenda na rin nina Galvez at Health Secretary Francisco Duque III kay Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte na gamitin na ang lahat ng paunang AstraZeneca vaccine doses na nasa bansa. \"'Yun ang recommendation ng WHO para magkaroon po ng larger population ng health workers na puwede maprotektahan. Kasi they assured us that there will be another tranche of AstraZeneca coming this April. May pa ang second dose nila,\u201d ani Galvez. Nakatakdang dumating ngayong Marso ang 1.4 milyong dose ng Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine, kung saan 1 milyon ang binili ng gobyerno at 400,000 naman ay donasyon ng bansang China. Inaasahan naman na sa Abril darating ang mahigit-kumulang na 1 milyong doses ng AstraZeneca vaccines. Posible ring dumating ang 4 milyon pang doses ng bakuna, kung saan kalahati ay bibilhin sa Sinovac, at o-orderin sa Gamaleya ang Sputnik V oras na magkaroon ito ng emergency use authorization (EUA). Sa Mayo, 8 milyong doses ng bakuna ang inaasahan, kasama ang 2.6 milyon mula AstraZeneca, at 200,000 mula Moderna. Kung dumating sa oras ang mga bakunang ito, kakayanin umanong magbakuna ng 1 milyong Pinoy kada linggo pagdating ng Abril, na inaasahang madodoble pagdating ng Mayo, at aabot naman ng 3 hanggang 5 milyon kada linggo pagdating ng Hunyo. Inaasahan na kalagitnaan ng Abril magsisimula ang pagbabakuna ng mga senior citizen, mahihirap, at vulnerable sector. Nasa 4 milyon pa lang na senior citizen ang nasa master list ng gobyerno pero inaasahang aakyat pa ito sa 9 milyon. Ayon kay Galvez, bakuna ng Sinovac ang posibleng ibigay sa kanila, kahit inirekomenda lang ito ng Food and Drug Administration sa mga malulusog na taong edad 18 hanggang 59 anyos. Nakipag-usap na rin ang Pilipinas sa Serum Institute of India para pag-aralan ang pagbabalik ng kakayahan ng Pilipinas na makapag-produce ng bakuna. \u201cGusto nila tulungan tayo na makapag-produce ng sarili nating bakuna.

Occupancy in 23 other health facilities is at high-risk level, or those which have 70 percent to 85 percent capacity, according to De Grano. RELATED STORIES: He also saw hospital occupancy increasing in Cebu City and the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). \u201cAround 40 percent lang ang occupancy all over the country. However, there are areas like the National Capital Region, probably Region 7 [in] Cebu, and I found out recently, \u2018yung CAR na mataas din ang kanilang occupancy rate,\u201d he said. (CAR has a high occupancy rate.) He noted that the One Hospital Command could help refer patients to other facilities. Launched in August last year, the command is a centralized hospital occupancy monitoring system that aims to smoothen referrals of COVID-19 patients. RELATED VIDEO: DOWNSIZING De Grano noted that some private hospitals previously had to \u201cdownsize,\u201d supposedly due to delays in PhilHealth reimbursements. He estimated that PHAPI members\u2019 unpaid PhilHealth claims amount to at least P6 billion. Downsizing, he said, is a \u201chuge problem\u201d that said hospitals had to face in the middle of the health emergency. The state insurer earlier suspended the interim reimbursement mechanism program to review its overall implementation following the call of some lawmakers over allegedly irregular fund allocations to some hospitals amid the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cAround P6 billion, that was in December.

If that\u2019s the case, the increase we will see won\u2019t be 3x, 4x, but up to 28 times increase.) \"And that will truly overwhelm our health system,\u201d she added. A variant is considered a variant of concern if through assessment, it is demonstrated to be \u201cassociated with increased transmissibility or detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology,\u201d among other things, according to the World Health Organization. Currently, there are 3 variants of concern in the Philippines: the B.1.1.7 first detected in the United Kingdom, the B.1.351 detected in South Africa, and the P.1 detected in Brazil. All are considered more transmissible, with the latter two said to contain an escape mutation that makes the virus better at evading a body\u2019s immune response. The UK variant has 41 local cases in the Cordillera Administrative Region, 39 in the National Capital Region, 4 in Calabarzon, 2 in Central Luzon, and 1 in Northern Mindanao. Local cases refer to patients who have not traveled outside of the country. For the South African variant, there are 64 cases in NCR, and 1 each in Cagayan Valley and Northern Mindanao. Among the 17 NCR cities, 13 have the UK variant, while 8 have the South African variant. \u201cMeron po tayong 74 or 27% ng lahat ng kaso ng variant of concern na returning overseas Filipino, at merong isang foreign national,\u201d De Guzman said. (We have 74 cases or 24% of all those with variants of concern involving returning overseas Filipino, and there is a foreign national.) The health official said this is important to note because there is really a possibility for a new variant to enter the country. Because the Philippines does not have any plans to close its borders again, the DOH said it wants to minimize the risk as much as possible. \u201cNapakahalaga yung patuloy na pagbabantay ng ating borders,\u201d De Guzman said. (It\u2019s important to continuously guard our borders.) De Guzman said only 6.6% of the COVID-positive samples sequenced by the Philippine Genome Center had variants of concern. \u201cNapakahalaga na ngayong maliit na porsyento pa lamang ng ating sini-sequence ang nagpopositibo sa mga variants of concern. Ibig sabihin, we really have the opportunity now na matigil na 'to, na 'wag nang lalo pang lumaki ang dami at porsyento ng mga nagiging positibo para sa variants of concern,\u201d she said. (It\u2019s important that those positive cases sequenced with variants of concern are only a small percentage. This means, we really have the opportunity now that this can stop, and for those testing positive for the variants of concern to no longer increase.) A graph shared by De Guzman to media showed that cities with one variant of concern had higher incidence rates of COVID-19 than those without. Cities with two variants of concern had much higher incidence rates. But De Guzman said the graph also shows that cases are really increasing, even in areas without the variants of concern. \u201cOo, nakaka-contribute talaga itong mga variants of concern doon sa mabilis na pagtaas ng kaso natin because that\u2019s the inherent characteristics of the variant,\u201d she said. (Yes, the variants of concern really contribute to the quick rise in cases because that\u2019s the inherent characteristics of the variant.) \u201cKahit wala tayong nakikita pang variant of concern sa maraming lugar sa Pilipinas, talagang merong pagtaas ng kaso dito sa iba\u2019t ibang rehiyon, iba\u2019t ibang probinsya, syudad at munisipyo natin. Ibig sabihin, hindi lang variants of concern ang dahilan ng pagtaas. Marami pang factors,\u201d she added. (Even if we are not seeing variants of concern in many areas in the Philippines, there is still an increase in cases in different regions, provinces, cities and municipalities. This means that the variants of concern is not the only reason for the increase. There are many other factors.) De Guzman said the other reasons include the non-compliance with health protocols and the increased mobility of people.

Ayon sa infectious disease expert na si Dr. Rontgene Solante, dapat paalalahanan ulit ang publiko na hindi pa tapos ang pandemya. \"Dapat ibalik 'yong compliance sa minimum health protocol. Okay lang [ang] increased mobility, pero dagdagan mo ingat mo,\" ani Solante. Ayon sa eksperto, hindi rin dapat balewalain ang oras kung kailan nagsimulang makaranas ng sintomas ng sakit, gaya ng lagnat, ubo, sipon at pananakit ng lalamunan. Una, dapat mag-isolate o humiwalay sa pamilya para hindi makahawa, at i-monitor ang sintomas. \"If there is one in the household transmitting the infection, mostly these are the symptomatics, because based on studies, if you're asymptomatic, your risk of transmission is very low,\" paliwanag ni Solante. Sunod na gawin ay makipag-ugnayan agad sa barangay health workers. Maaari ring tumawag sa personal o family doctor. Kung hindi naman emergency case, magpakonsulta o humingi muna ng rekomendasyon sa pamamagitan ng tawag bago pumunta sa isang isolation facility o ospital. Iwasan ding mag-self-medicate at huwag balewalain ang sakit. \"All symptomatic, even the mild, should be evaluated thoroughly. So that's the gap, the area that we are so negligent, na 'Ah, kaunti lang 'yong symptom na ito, okay na 'ko nito,'\" ani Solante. Ayon kay Solante, hindi sapat na mag-isolate sa bahay dahil may posibilidad pa ring maipasa ang virus sa iba. Dapat din umanong magsuot ng face mask, mag-disinfect at ugaliing maghugas ng kamay. Isa ang San Juan sa mga lungsod na halos puno na ang isolation facilities pero hindi pa rin isinusulong ang home quarantine, lalo't kung masikip ang bahay, at walang sariling kuwarto at banyo. \"Mayroon tayong kino-convert na additional school buildings, ating mga public schools, into quarantine facilities,\" ani San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora. \"That's another challenge by our government, to put up more of these facilities because the hospitals cannot accommodate them... Itong mga mild symptoms, doon 'yan sa mga quarantine facilities,\" ani Solante. Dapat din umanong sumunod sa rekomendasyon ng local government unit at doktor hinggil sa swab test at pag-quarantine. Bukod sa barangay, dapat ding ipagbigay-alam sa employer ang situwasyon ng pasyente. Kung dumeretso naman sa ospital ang pasyente, naitatawag rin anila ang mga kaso sa barangay para makapag-contact tracing. Para makaiwas sa sakit, muling pinaalala ni Solante na huwag nang lumabas ng bahay kung hindi naman kailangan. Para naman sa mga pumapasok sa trabaho, iminumungkahing huwag munang sumabay kumain sa mga kasama sa bahay, lalo kung may senior citizen o immunocompromised.

The word came up multiple times as she recounted her experiences at work. Linda, 49, said she feels like she is on call the entire day, attending to queries of students and parents even at ungodly hours, unlike before when it felt like teachers were relieved of their duties after work hours. \u201cAng hirap kasi hindi katulad dati, noon na face-to-face, na after mong magturo sa mga bata, tapos na \u2018yong responsibility mo sa kanila\u2026 \u2018Di katulad ngayon, parang 24 hours,\u201d she said. (It\u2019s difficult because it\u2019s not like before, when there was face-to-face classes, after you teach the children, you\u2019re finished with your responsibilities to them\u2026 unlike now, it feels like you\u2019re at work for 24 hours.) Linda also said distance learning does not seem to be effective for children without adults to guide them in their studies at home, recounting how some of her first grade students still found it difficult to read. But Linda and her young pupils are not the only ones having difficulties with the new setup. Grade 12 student Marl Mora also said he experiences challenges that hinder him from fully absorbing his lessons. \u201cKaunti lang \u2018yong natutunan\u2026. Kapag magre-rely sa module lang, kaunti lang talaga \u2018yong matututunan. Kapag puro search [sa internet] naman, mas madali siyang nakakalimutan,\u201d he said. (I don\u2019t learn a lot\u2026 If you rely on modules alone, you won\u2019t really learn much. If you rely on internet searches, you easily forget what you are supposed to learn.) \u201cSa internet, minsan unstable and nawawala. Hindi makapag-connect sa class kaya minsan naiiwan,\u201d he added. (Sometimes our internet is unstable and sometimes we lose connection. We can\u2019t connect to the class so we are left behind.) Mora also helps earn money for his family by selling vegetables, which he said was stressful since he juggles it with his studies. \u201cMahirap kumita ng pera kaya dagdag-pagod. Namamalengke kami every other day ng madaling araw, mga 3 or 4 a.m. kaya halos laging puyat tapos sasabayan pa ng modules na maraming gawain kaya medyo masakit sa ulo,\u201d he said. (It\u2019s hard to earn money so it\u2019s more exhausting. We go to the market every other day, around 3 or 4 a.m. so I don\u2019t get enough sleep. Along with that, I have to answer modules so it\u2019s a bit of a headache.) Because of these experiences, both Linda and Mora said that they are in favor of limited face-to-face classes. \u201cHindi pa rin kasi mapapalitan ang experience and ang knowledge na matutunan kapag face-to-face learning. Kahit na half day or half lang ng classes,\u201d Mora said. (You can\u2019t replace the experience and knowledge that you learn when there\u2019s face-to-face classes. They should allow even half-day classes or half of the class to attend.) \u201cAt least \u2018yong mga bata, magkaroon din ng communication sa teacher nila kasi lalo na ang primary grade, kailangan hands on \u2018yong teacher sa bata,\u201d said Linda. (At least the children could communicate with their teacher, especially those in the primary grade. Teachers need to be hands on with children.) Calls for the safe reopening of schools have been growing, a year since government prohibited in-person classes. It remains unknown, however, when face-to-face instruction would continue, especially since President Rodrigo Duterte remained reluctant to send students back to classrooms. Duterte earlier said he would only allow in-person classes once COVID-19 vaccines become available in the country. But during the arrival of the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines from China last Feb. 28, Duterte said he would still not allow physical classes. \u201cI cannot make that decision. It will place the children in jeopardy\u2026 I am not ready to lose the lives of our young people,\u201d Duterte said. Prior to this, Duterte gave the green light for a dry run of limited in-person classes, acknowledging that the distance learning set up was \u201cfar from ideal.\u201d He later cancelled this due to the concerns with the more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom. Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles had said Duterte could reconsider authorizing the pilot test for face-to-face classes once the country has rolled out 2 million COVID-19 vaccines, even though United Nations International Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) does not recommend vaccination as a \u201cprerequisite\u201d for the reopening of schools. Need for in-person classes The DepEd, which is pushing for the gradual resumption of in-person classes, saw the need for face-to-face instruction to address the challenges in distance learning, such as uneven access to technology and students\u2019 difficulty in self-learning. A nationwide online survey conducted by the Movement for Safe, Equitable, Quality, and Relevant Education found that a majority of teachers \u201cdo not think or are not confident that the competencies set by the Department of Education under distance learning are actually being developed.\u201d Several lawmakers and groups have also called for the safe reopening of schools. The Senate, last March 2, passed a resolution recommending the conduct of in-person classes where there are few to zero COVID-19 cases. The Philippines is the only country in the Asia-Pacific region that has yet to reopen schools, even on a limited scale to complement distance learning modalities. John Andrew Camposano of the Philippine Pediatric Society warned that \u201cone year of school closure would be equivalent to 2 years of learning loss.\u201d \u201cIn the long term, there is also an increased risk of disengagement or dropouts, there is a decrease in motivation to learn. Some children may not return to school,\u201d Camposano said in a Senate hearing last Feb. 24. Philippine Business for Education Executive Director Love Basillote said prolonged school closure might lead to heavier losses for the country\u2019s economy. Those who dropped out from school in 2020 may have difficulty landing jobs since companies would look for candidates with credentials and specific skill sets, she said. Over 26.6 million students registered in basic education for School Year 2020-2021, based on DepEd data last Jan. 15, down by around a million from the previous year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones had said the department was ready to hold the dry run of in-person classes \u201cany time that the president says go.\u201d Schools as a refuge for the abused Aside from learning, schools also serve as safe havens for children experiencing violence in their homes, said Behzad Noubary, deputy representative of UNICEF in the Philippines. \u201cSchools beyond being a place of learning for children also serve as a place for socialization\u2026 As well as a refuge for children who may be experiencing physical or psychological violence outside of the school,\u201d he said. Experts have also said the pandemic has put children\u2019s social development at risk since they lost opportunities to bond with other kids. In higher education, Duterte has allowed in-person classes for select medical courses in areas with low quarantine restriction levels to ensure that the country had enough health frontliners during the pandemic. As of writing, the country has recorded 631,320 COVID-19 cases as it also faced a surge in infections. \u2013 With reports from Arra Perez, Jamaine Punzalan, and Sherrie Ann Torres, ABS-CBN News"}, {"title": "ALAMIN: Serious adverse effect ng bakuna kontra COVID-19, tinalakay", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "date": "Mar 17 2021 06:09 PM", "content": "MAYNILA - Maraming katanungan pa rin ang nais na masagot ng publiko hinggil sa magiging epekto ng mga bakuna kontra COVID-19. Sa segment na \u201cBakuna Muna\u201d sa programang Kabayan sa TeleRadyo nitong Miyerkoles, binigyang-linaw ni Dr. Lulu Bravo, chairperson ng National Adverse Effect Following Immunization Committee, ang ilang agam-agam ng publiko. POSIBLENG SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECT NG BAKUNA: \u201cAng isang serious effect ay anaphylactic shock at ito ay ang severe allergy na ngayon nakikita rin natin, pero sa naunang report sa atin ng CoronaVac at Astra ay hindi nakasaad sa kanilang report. Hindi lumabas sa report nila, pero ngayon nakikita natin dito sa ating monitoring system. Medyo kailangang imbestigahan pa kasi sa mga naunang mga report bago pa tayo nag-umpisang mag rollout, syempre pinag-aaralan yan ng ating mga eksperto, parang \u2018di nakita masyado yung anaphylaxis kaya ngayon tinitingnan natin, iniimbestigahan natin kung talagang yang anaphylaxis na yan ay nakikita nang mas marami kaysa doon sa ibang mga bansa. Handang-handa na ang ating vaccinators sa tinatawag nating anaphylaxis kasi nakita nga nila meron talagang posibleng mangyaring ganyan so handa ang emergency kit ng bawat vaccination center.\u201d MAAARI BANG MA-CONFINE SA OSPITAL ANG MAKARARANAS NG ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK? \u201cIba-iba, may iba mabilis lang mawala, meron talaga a few hours nasa emergency room, binabantayan sila, nawawala agad, nakaka-uwi agad. Meron namang medyo severe pati kaniyang blood pressure bumabagsak naman. Ang anaphylaxis karaniwang bagsak ang blood pressure. Pagka medyo bumabagsak ang blood pressure dapat bantayan kasi delikado yung bumabagsak ang blood pressure. We are really exercising the outmost care for our patients.\u201d UPDATE SA ISYU NG BLOOD CLOTTING SA BAKUNANG ASTRAZENECA: \u201cNaireport yan sa Norway, sa Austria, at temporarily may mga bansa sa Europa, and even sa Asia, itong Thailand, itinigil muna nila temporarily yung pagbabakuna. Tinanong namin ang WHO. Ang sabi ng WHO, yes, its under investigation in that country pero halos 17-M na ang nabigyan ng AstraZeneca at hindi naman nila nakita na mayroong ganung klaseng concern o red flag na hindi maganda, na yung thromboembolism ay talagang dumami sa 17 million na nabakuhan. Tingin nila, kailangan lang talaga i-compare mo doon sa mga countries na yun kung yung thromboembolism na yun mas marami doon sa mga nabakunahan kesa doon sa mga hindi pa nababakunahan.\u201d MAY BAKUNA NA BA KONTRA COVID-19 PARA SA BATA? \u201cWala pa tayong bakuna ng COVID para sa 18 years old, pababa. Yung hindi pa nag-18 hindi pa dapat bakunahan, wala pang bakuna dyan.\u201d MAY EXPIRATION BA ANG BAKUNA: \u201cMerong expiration date yun, At ang alam ko yung sa AstraZeneca, parang May 2021. Yung sa Sinovac ay 2024 pa. Gagawa sila ng paraan na hindi mag-expire yan kasi sayang naman ang bakuna.\u201d LIGTAS BA NA MAGPABAKUNA ANG SENIOR CITIZEN NA DIABETIC AT HYPERTENSIVE: \u201cSa ngayon, ang mga senior citizen na 60 and above ay ang Astra lang ang pwedeng ibigay. Yung sa Sinovac, unless you sign a waiver na wala ka namang ibang kondisyon like hypertension, diabetes hindi pa kasi yan nirerekomenda kasi kulang ang datos na itong Sinovac na naibigay sa mga maysakit na may hypertension at diabetes. Pero yung sa Astra, meron na tayong datos kaya yun ay narerekomenda sa senior citizens, at doon sa may hypertension din, diabetes, asthma\u2014yung tinatawag nating comorbidities, may ibang sakit sila.\u201d PAGBABAKUNA SA TAONG NAGPOSITIBONG SA COVID-19: \u201cHindi tayo nagte-test bago mabakunahan kung ikaw ay may COVID o wala, although sa screening tinatanong kung meron siyang naging sakit na COVID bago bakunahan. Kasi kung nagkasakit ka ng COVID, you will receive a vaccine only after 90 days. Dapat ganun, pero kung ikaw naman unintentionally, \u2018di mo alam na meron ka na palang COVID tapos nabakunahan ka, ang tingin namin hindi masama yun kaya lang hindi porket nabakunahan ka ay hindi na magpo-progress yung COVID mo because there is a possibility na yung COVID mo na nag-iincubate, nag-uumpisa pa lang pero \u2018di mo alam ay magtuloy-tuloy at posible kang magkaroon ng sakit in the following days. Pero yung bakuna mo, sa tingin namin, hindi makakasama pero hindi rin makakatulong na i-stop yun COVID mo.\u201d Magugunitong nakatanggap ang Pilipinas ng 600,000 doses ng Sinovac mula China at 525,000 shots naman ng AstraZeneca mula sa COVAX Facility.

This is the 6th straight day that newly-confirmed cases exceeded 4,000, data showed. But the day\u2019s additional cases do not include results from six Department of Health (DOH)-accredited testing laboratories that failed to submit data on time. ABS-CBN Data Analytics Head Edson Guido said this is the first time that the trend happened since the pandemic hit the country. The ABS-CBN Investigative and Research Group noted that the day's number of new cases is the sixth highest so far this year. The health department earlier in the day admitted that new COVID-19 cases in the country had reached the same peak level in July last year, noting as well the rise of infections in households or offices. With 561,099 total recoveries and 12,866 total COVID-related fatalities, active infections stood at 61,733, or 9.7 percent of the cumulative total cases. Guido said the number of active cases in the country is the highest since Sept. 26 last year. Some 96.8 percent of the patients still battling the disease are experiencing mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, the latest bulletin showed. A total of 1.2 percent are critically ill, while 1.3 percent are severely ill. The DOH logged 374 additional recoveries, and 18 new deaths. It is the second straight day that additional fatalities counted fewer than 20. The Philippine Statistics Authority earlier said that almost 28,000 died in the country last year due to COVID-19, but the DOH clarified that probable and suspect cases were included in the statistics agency\u2019s data. Out of 37,608 individuals who last underwent testing for COVID-19, 5,321 or 14.1 percent were found to be positive for the disease. A total of 9 duplicate cases have been removed from the list. Six of those were found to be recoveries. Five cases initially classified as recoveries, on the other hand, turned out to be deaths after the agency's final validation. The OCTA Research Group this week projected that if the current trend continues, new coronavirus cases in the Philippines can reach up to 11,000 daily. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III rejected placing Metro Manila under stricter lockdown even as the region continues to log most of the newly-reported infections. Globally, the COVID-19 already infected almost 121 million, of whom 2.7 million have died and 68.4 million have recovered, based on US-based Johns Hopkins University's running tally.

The health official assured the public that they are also tracking the said deaths but that they are dependent on information shared by local reporting units. \u201cAt the end of the day, the strategy is the same.

The number of people who died due to ischemic heart diseases rose to 99,700 cases (17.3 percent) compared to 97,500 cases (15.7 percent) in 2019, PSA added. Cancer was the second leading cause of death, with 62,300 (10.8 percent) cases recorded. Cerebrovascular diseases claimed 59,700 (10.4 percent) lives in 2020, while diabetes mellitus ranked fourth with 37,300 cases (6.5 percent). The top 3 causes of death in the Philippines remained the same in the last 5 years, PSA added. But the number of registered deaths due to ischemic heart diseases and diabetes mellitus exceeded their averages in the last five years of 82, 527 and 32,991, respectively deaths caused by pneumonia had the biggest decline, with 24,300 thousand less deaths in 2020 than its average in the past five years.

It was still however the fifth leading cause of death for the year, it said. PREVENTING HEART DISEASES In its manual \"Dietary Guidelines for the Prevention of Heart Disease and Diabetes,\" the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI-DOST) recommended the following: - Prepare and eat foods that are low in fat and cholesterol. Fat should contribute about 20-25% of the total calories we eat. Fat from plant sources like peanuts, soybeans, cottonseed, corn, safflower, and from fish oil are better than animal fat.\r\n- Eat foods that are high in fiber. Fibers especially the soluble ones have cholesterol-lowering properties and are found in most fruits, vegetables, beans and grains.\r\n- Limit intake of salty foods. Sodium in salt causes hypertension when taken in excess. Convenience foods like tocino, longanisa, sausage, hotdog, ham, bacon and the like are rich in salt.\r\n- Always maintain an ideal weight. Overweight or obese persons are more prone to heart disease.\r\n- Exercise regularly. At least 15-30 minutes of physical exercise, 3-4 times weekly, can help reduce your risks for heart disease. It also lowers blood pressure and cholesterol.\r\n- Stop smoking.

Lawyer Rey Cortez, secretary general of National Union of Peoples' Lawyers, welcomed that the Supreme Court magistrates were considering a proposal requiring law enforcers to wear body cameras to prevent abuses in the service of warrants. \"But of course, it's a complex issue. Wearing of a body cam will only solve a part of the problem,\" he told ANC. \"What NUPL wants is the Supreme Court should include in its resolution safeguards, in addition to just simply wearing body cams.\" The human rights lawyer noted that law enforcers were \"very creative\" when they enforced warrants. Based on his experience, law enforcers would barge into a house, herd the occupants into a separate place and conduct the search. A second search is conducted with the presence of witnesses such as village officials where \"usually they find alleged firearms and explosives,\" Cortez said. \"If first they will not wear body cameras, hindi natin makikita 'yong mga planting of evidence at sa mga irregularities doon sa pagpasok palang,\" he added. (... we will not see the planting of evidence and other irregularities even when they enter a place.) The lawyers' group also raised concern about the manner the warrants were issued. The Philippine Constitution and the Rules of Court require judges to personally determine if there is probable cause to issue arrest or search warrants after examining the complainant and witnesses under oath. \"Hindi ito isang subpoena (This is not a subpoena) that you can issue as a matter of fact, as a matter of procedure,\" he said. \"This is a process you issue that will authorize law enforces to intrude into the privacy of individuals, which is an exception to the constitutional right to privacy.\" Human rights and lawyers\u2019 groups have long raised the issue of courts acting as \u201cwarrant factories\u201d issuing multiple search warrants in a day or two. Cortez was reacting to a statement from the Supreme Court that the police applied for 72 search warrants for the raids on March 7 that eventually became a \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d in Calabarzon. The police and military implemented 24 search warrants in Cavite, Batangas and Rizal that left 9 activists dead and 3 others arrested. Among those killed were Manny Asuncion, coordinator of activist group Bagong Alyansang Makabayan in Cavite, and fisherfolk leaders Chai Lemita-Evangelista and Ariel Evangelista in Batangas.

The group of professors, led by newly-installed Dean Edgardo Carlo Vistan II, said they were \"deeply troubled and concerned by this brazen and outright attempt to curtail legal rights and civil liberties.\" \u201cSeveral of our professional brethren have already been killed for no clear reason other than that they represented accused who were alleged to be members of communist groups or allied organizations,\u201d the letter read. In a letter dated March 12, 2021, Police Lt. Fernando Calabria, Jr., the intelligence chief of the Calbayog Police Station, asked the Office of the Clerk of Court in Calbayog Regional Trial Court for a list of lawyers who represent \u201cCTG personalities in court.\u201d No reason was cited for the request but the letter drew widespread condemnation because attached to it was a table with a heading in one column captioned \u201cmode of neutralization.\u201d Police have used the term \u201cneutralization\u201d in police reports on drug cases to refer to killings, as pointed out by the June 2020 report of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. \u201cThis police action is clearly meant to (a) intimidate lawyers from representing persons that the government has tagged as alleged members of CTGs even without benefit of trial, (b) indirectly deprive persons accused as \u2018CTG personalities\u2019 of their right to counsel by frightening lawyers from being associated with them, even if they do so as officers of the court, and (c) provide the PNP with another \u2018list\u2019 of \u2018personalities\u2019 against whom they may decide to take other actions in the future,\u201d the professors said. The PNP\u2019s move is a \u201cpatent demonstration of impunity\" aside from being a blatant attempt to make courts complicit in possible violations of constitutional rights, the letter read. \u201cIt should not be left to stand. Never in the history of our country has there ever been such an open and flagrant attempt to cow the legal community into shirking their sworn duties as lawyers and officers of the court through an act of discrimination and inquisition clearly targeting lawyers for representing a particular category of accused clients,\u201d it said. PNP OIC Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar has relieved Calabria from his post and has apologized to the legal community over Calabria\u2019s \u201creckless behavior\u201d but he denied there is an order from top PNP officials for such a letter request. But Calabria in his letter to Calbayog RTC cited \u201ccompliance from higher PNP offices.\u201d Vistan also said in his letter to the SC that similar letters making the same request have been received by other judges. JUDGE RED-TAGGED On the same day that UP Law professors submitted their letter to the Supreme Court, the judge who junked the illegal possession of firearms and explosives cases against journalist Lady Ann Salem and unionist Rodrigo Esparago became the target of red-tagging herself.

Judge Monique Quisumbing-Ignacio RTC Br. 209, Mandaluyong City sa mabilis na paglaya ng kasama nating Lady Ann Salem at Rodrigo Esparago. Tuloy ang Laban!!!

Ferdinand Gaite said in sharing the photo of the tarpaulin. \u201cI condemn this act of intimidation against Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio. Hands off the Judiciary! Hands off Human Rights Lawyers!\u201d he added. Quisumbing-Ignacio voided the search warrant issued by Quezon City Executive Judge Cecilyn Burgos-Villavert for being \u201cvague.\u201d Gaite referred to the incident as \u201ctarpaulin terrorism.\u201d Several tarpaulins have previously been hanged in different parts of Metro Manila condemning the CPP-NPA-NDF although no one has claimed responsibility for the tarps. \u201cThe tarps speak for themselves. Independent, fair minded judges are under attack. Who has the motive to produce such inanity other than those extremely fond of red-tagging. Their handiwork will boomerang on them,\u201d the group KAPATID said in reaction to the tarpaulins. In a statement, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines urged all parties not to drag judges into their political or ideological issues or agenda. \"We enjoin all litigants, parties, and sectors not to unduly drag our magistrates into their political, ideological, or operational battles or agenda. Instead of terrorizing or attacking the judges, bring before them the best evidence and arguments so that they may discern the truth and act solely based on facts and the applicable laws,\" IBP National President Domingo Egon Cayosa said. \"As we advocate for JUSTICE BILIS, we pray that our judges will have the courage to do what the law requires them to do, though dangerous or unpopular and the integrity to remain unswayed by identity, race, gender, relationship, wealth, or politics,\" he added. WHAT CAN SC DO? While the UP Law Faculty letter did not mention the latest red-tagging incident involving Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio, it called on the Supreme Court to use its power to promulgate rules for the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights as well as its administrative supervision over all courts and personnel. \u201cThese powers may be exercised motu proprio \u2014 and in these urgent circumstances, must be so exercised \u2014 by requiring an official explanation from the PNP leadership, at the first instance, and commencing proceedings perhaps towards ensuring that such instances never, ever happen again.\u201d In an accompanying letter, Dean Vistan asked SC to convene a \u201cSpecial Committee to Protect Lawyers\u201d to probe the Calbayog PNP letter and other attempts to profile and red-tag lawyers, verify the number of lawyers killed and study the need to amend the rules on writs of amparo and habeas data.

Fifty-four lawyers in the Philippines have been killed due to work-related reasons under the Duterte administration, according to NUPL. Another lawyers\u2019 group, the Free Legal Assistance Group, came out with its own study showing 61 lawyers have been killed since 2016 when Duterte took office, more than the number of lawyers killed in the previous 6 administrations combined. Lawyers and rights groups have warned red-tagging has dangerous consequences such as the killing of human rights lawyer Benjamin Ramos.

Deaths due to suicide spiked to 3,529 last year, which is 25.7 percent higher compared to the 2,808 deaths due to self-harm in 2019, the PSA said in a statement released on March 16. The study covered deaths reported in the Philippines from January to December 2020, but has yet to account for Filipinos who died abroad, the PSA said. Earlier, experts said pandemic fatigue is affecting more Filipinos, endangering the general public\u2019s mental health. This was evident in the increase of calls to helplines, fully-booked consultation schedules, and rise in activities that sought to combat stress. Psychologist Randy Dellosa said Filipinos have grown \u201csick and tired of trying to consider as a \u2018new normal\u2019 what in reality is an obvious \u2018abnormal.\u2019\u2019 Estimates also showed some 3.6 million Filipinos suffered from mental health problems, but getting accurate numbers remained a challenge as access to healthcare professionals became more difficult during the pandemic. Based on the national prevalence study on mental, neurological and substance use disorders reported by National Mental Health Program by Frances Prescilla Cuevas, at least 1,145,871 people are suffering from depressive disorder. Up until October 6, the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) received around 32 to 37 calls since March 17, raising the monthly average calls to 907. Data from October onwards are unavailable as of posting. Despair was also palpable as over 420,000 Filipinos lost their jobs in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PSA divided COVID-19 deaths into 2 categories: those who succumbed to the virus, and those who were identified to be carriers of the disease after they died. \"COVID-19 with virus not identified was the seventh leading cause of death in the country with 19,800 cases or 3.4 percent of the total deaths in 2020,\" the study read. \"Registered deaths due to COVID-19 accounted for 8,200 or 1.4 percent of the total deaths in 2020, pushing its rank to number 16,\" it said. Deaths linked to road accidents decreased in 2020, the year when the government had to impose lockdowns and limit movement in Luzon and other parts of the country to curb the spread of COVID-19. Deaths due to transport accidents decreased to 8,000, a 37.4 percent drop compared to the 12,800 incidents in 2019, the PSA said. Assault-related deaths also declined by 32 percent in 2020, it said.

Sinas arrived in the province via helicopter, which Dolor said required coordination since health screenings were being conducted in the pier. There are no health personnel at the airport because there are no regular flights, he added. Dolor said local police officers who were exposed to Sinas had been quarantined and were scheduled to be tested for the virus. The country's top cop went to the province for the ceremonial vaccination of medical workers of Mimaropa police.

The PNP chief underwent another swab test on March 11 for his visit to Palawan, which turned out positive, Panaligan added. \"If there is really no coordination with the city government upon the arrival, then this can be considered a breach of health protocol,\" Dolor said. 'FALSE INFORMATION' In response to the incident, Mimaropa police director Brig. Gen. Pascual Mu\u00f1oz maintained that Sinas complied with health protocols. \"Contrary to the circulating false information about the non- observance of the COVID-19 health protocols, PGEN DEBOLD M SINAS , Chief, PNP actually complied and accomplished more than what was required of him for his travel to Oriental Mindoro,\" he said in a statement released Sunday. Before arriving at the Calapan airport, Sinas filled out an online registration and received a confirmation message of his visit, which were the only requirements by the city government for authorized persons outside residence, Mu\u00f1oz said. The police official added that Sinas underwent health screening from the medical team of the regional health service of Mimaropa police. Minimum health standards such as physical distancing were also observed during Sinas' visit, he added.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\"In these trying times, we are asking everyone to refrain from sharing any false information that may trigger hatred from the public,\" Mu\u00f1oz said. \"Instead, we are enjoining everyone to pray for the health, safety and protection of everyone especially our dear CPNP, PGEN DEBOLD M SINAS and all the frontliners.\" Last year, Sinas, then a Metro Manila police director, was charged for allegedly violating health protocols for holding a \"ma\u00f1anita\" or dawn serenade for his 55th birthday celebration.

In its daily situationer released on Tuesday, the Department of Health said there were 25,732 active COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila. The region also accounted for 2,842 in the new reported infections for the day. \"As of now, I don\u2019t because the localized lockdowns are starting to yield positive outcomes,\" Duque told ANC's Headstart when asked if he recommends that the capital region return to a stricter lockdown. Metro Manila as a whole is currently under general community quarantine, the second loosest lockdown level, but mayors have implemented restrictions in targeted areas within their constituencies. The region also observes a curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. and a ban on minors going outdoors. Duque said the granular lockdowns' effect will reflect in about 2 weeks, and \"if nothing changes and the cases continue to rise, then the possibility of a more widespread lockdown is certainly strong.\" \"Everything is possible, but we have to calibrate our response depending on the data that come in with the recommendation of our technical advisory group and our epidemiologist of the IATF\u2026If they say that we need to have a more widespread lockdown, then we will recommend to the President,\" he said. One measure the government recently imposed is closing national borders to foreigners and returning Filipinos who are not overseas workers starting March 20. Duque said travel restrictions are \"temporary\" and are \"not there for long,\" as officials monitor the data on infection spikes closely. The Philippines has been tallying at least 4,000 daily additional COVID-19 cases in the past 5 days. According to monitoring by ABS-CBN Data Analytics, a similar trend occurred on Aug. 18-22 last year. The OCTA Research Group projected that if the current trend continues, new coronavirus cases in the Philippines can reach up to 11,000 daily. Dr. Beverly Lorraine Ho, director of Department of Health's disease prevention and control bureau, said the rising number of added infections can be attributed to \"breaches in the health protocols,\" increased mobility, and the presence new coronavirus variants.

Ret. Gen. Restituto Padilla said earlier Wednesday that only those aged 18 to 65 would be allowed to travel, in a bid to curb a recent surge in coronavirus infections. But hours after his announcement, Padilla said, \"I stand corrected.\" \"The NTF allows minors to travel with their families point to point. The only restriction is their movement within Metro Manila specially to malls and crowded areas consistent with the announcement of the MMDA,\" he said in a text message. \"They may also avail of domestic air travel with their families specially during the season of lent and their academic break,\" he added. Metro Manila from Wednesday banned minors outside their residences as new daily COVID-19 infections surged to levels similar to the early months of the pandemic crisis last year. The inter-agency task force leading the country's pandemic response has yet to discuss whether or not to ban domestic travel of minors, said Tourism Secretary Berna Romulo-Puyat. Romulo-Puyat said she only learned of Padilla's previous announcement after some social media users asked her if they may not bring along minors on tourist trips. Tourism has reopened in areas under modified general community quarantine, the loosest of 4 lockdown levels. These areas include Boracay and Palawan, she said. Metro Manila, the epicenter of the outbreak, is under general community quarantine, but several measures have been put in place to arrest the fresh surge, including a curfew, liquor ban, and limits on flight arrivals, among others. \"Makikiusap kami.

A Resolution will be drafted which will be further considered soonest,\u201d Supreme Court spokesperson Brian Keith Hosaka said in a statement. Sources from the high court said SC justices had a \u201clong conversation\u201d about the issue during their weekly en banc session. The proposal was \u201cunilateral\u201d or based on the initiative of some justices, meaning, there were no parties who filed any requests regarding the proposed measure. Human rights lawyers have previously called on the Supreme Court to review the rules on the issuance and implementation of search warrants after simultaneous raids in Batangas, Cavite and Rizal ended up in the killing of 9 activists. One of the sources confirmed to ABS-CBN News that the discussion on the use of body cameras was \u201crelated to the furor over [the] implementation by police of warrants that have resulted in deaths.\u201d RELATIVES, WITNESSES CONTEST POLICE VERSION Police have claimed that in all 9 instances, the activists supposedly fought back and resisted arrest. As evidence, police presented guns, ammunitions and grenades supposedly recovered from the possession of the deceased. But relatives and witnesses have contested the police\u2019s version of the events. The mothers of couple Ariel Evangelista and Chai Lemita-Evangelista said the couple were handcuffed, dragged away from the cottage they were staying in and brought to a nearby house where they were later shot, based on what Ariel\u2019s 10-year-old child saw. The lawyer of Bayan Cavite coordinator Manny Asuncion said there was no service of search warrant. Law enforcers allegedly barged into his office and brought Asuncion into a room where he was killed. Relatives of Puroy dela Cruz, a member of the Dumagat tribe, who was killed in his house in a remote village in Tanay, Rizal pointed out there could not have been a shootout since they were surrounded by dozens of uniformed and armed policemen. They also pointed out, if dela Cruz fought back, why were bullet holes found only on one side of his house? Relatives also denied the activists killed and even those arrested owned guns, ammunition or explosives. The daughter of 61-year-old paralegal Nimfa Lanzanas, who is currently detained after being charged with illegal possession of firearms and explosives, said it would have been impossible for her elderly mother to keep dangerous firearms and explosives in a house with 3 minors. The PNP earlier rejected allegations policemen resorted to planting of evidence. But questions surrounding the proper implementation of search warrants had long been raised, most recently with the arrest of journalist Lady Ann Salem and 6 trade unionists on International Human Rights Day last year. Salem and her companion Rodrigo Esparago were later cleared of illegal possession of firearms and explosives after a Mandaluyong court voided the search warrant against them for being \u201cvague.\u201d Police confiscated cellphones and laptops not specified in the search warrant, in what the court described as a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d Activists and rights groups have claimed the Philippine government is \u201cweaponizing\u201d search warrants against alleged communist rebels, urging the Supreme Court to review the rules on search warrants to prevent further bloodshed. SUPREME COURT RESPONSE In the wake of the killings, Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta directed Court Administrator Midas Marquez to submit a report surrounding the issuance of the search warrants used on \u201cBloody Sunday.\u201d In his report, Marquez said the PNP applied for a total of 72 search warrants before the Manila and Antipolo regional trial courts a few days before \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d of which 46 search warrants were issued after 2 days of hearings. But he stressed: \u201c\u2026the issuance of the search warrants by the judges and their judges and their service or implementation by the law enforcers are two (2) different acts.\u201d Last week, chief justice nominee SC Associate Justice Ramon Paul Hernando also sought to defend judges who issued search warrants according to the rules, during his interview with the Judicial and Bar Council. \u201cIf he really issued it on the basis of what our rules required, I think the judge should not be blamed for that. It\u2019s a different thing when it comes to the implementation of the search warrant,\u201d he said. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, for his part, did not discount the possibility of abuses in the service of search warrants. \u201cKung minsan, may tendency na gumamit ng unnecessary force ang mga nag-eenforce o nagseserve ng search warrants kaya nandoon ang problema,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we need to do is for people affected to bring it to the attention of the proper authorities concerned so that the proper administrative and necessary criminal sanctions can be imposed,\u201d he said. BODY CAMERAS The Philippine National Police had previously entertained the issue of using body cameras during police operations following the thousands of suspects killed in drug operations. That proposal had languished for years since it was proposed in 2017. It is not immediately clear how the PNP will comply should the Supreme Court decide to require the use of body cameras in the implementation of warrants."}, {"title": "6 barangay sa Maynila na nagtala ng higit 10 COVID-19 cases, isinailalim sa lockdown", "author": "Lady Vicencio, ABS-CBN News", "date": "Mar 17 2021 05:52 AM", "content": "MAYNILA - Nagsimula na ang apat na araw na lockdown sa mga idineklarang critical zone sa Maynila dahil sa mataas na kaso ng COVID-19.
