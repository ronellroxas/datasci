Participants can register for free and view all the lectures and talks on the PHIDEX website. The expo will run until March 21.  Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat said PHIDEX 2021 is one of their ways of supporting the country's diving industry. \"As the Philippines is known around the world for its diving destinations, it is truly important that we do everything we can to sustain the local diving industry. The latest recognition we received was from the 2020 World Travel Awards which named the Philippines as the World\u2019s Leading Dive Destination,\" she said. \"This year's PHIDEX is a step in the right direction to sustain our gains toward recovery, for all to enjoy the natural wonders our archipelago can provide,\" she added. For this year's expo, the PHIDEX website will host three stages: the main stage, the expo stage, and the panel stage. Aside from attending discussions, participants can also buy equipment and experiences from partners and exhibitors during the three-day event through a virtual marketplace called Dive Travel Exchange or TRAVEX."}, {"title": "Sylvia Sanchez, ibinahagi ang 'magandang' kapalit nang pagkakaroon noon ng COVID-19", "author": "ABS-CBN News", "date": "Mar 19 2021 01:39 PM", "content": "MAYNILA -- Muling binalikan ng aktres na si Sylvia Sanchez ang naging karanasan na sumubok sa tatag ng kanyang pananalig sa Diyos. Noong nakaraang taon, nagpositibo sa coronavirus si Sanchez at kanyang mister na si Art Atayde. Sa media conference para sa pinakabagong serye ng ABS-CBN na \"Huwag Kang Mangamba\" kung saan isa si Sanchez sa mga bituin, sinabi ng aktres na mas naging matatag ang kanilang pamilya dahil dito. \"Honestly, sa totoo lang, wala akong kuwestiyon kay Lord bakit nangyari sa akin 'yon. Wala akong pain, wala akong sakit, kung bakit nangyari sa amin 'yon. Kasi ang kapalit nun ay mas naging close ang buong pamilya. May magandang kapalit 'yon. Nagkaroon ako ng takot, yes. Para kay Chubby and kay Gela, kay Arjo, kay Ria na mahawa, lalo na 'yung bunso. Kasi at that time walang puwedeng sumama (na hindi) COVID-positive sa loob ng hospital. Natakot ako roon para sa bunso talaga,\" ani Sanchez. Giit ng aktres, maraming biyaya ang dumating sa kanyang buhay mula nang gumaling sila sa COVID-19. \"Sumatutal walang negative kahit ano na nangyari sa buhay ko last year kasi ang kapalit nun blessings. Ang dami-daming nangyaring magaganda sa buhay ko after nun. So papaano ko kukuwestiyunan 'yung isang beses na nagka-COVID kami, na thank God nalagpasan namin, kumpara doon sa binigay naman Niya after? Sabi ko nga, lahat tayo, karamihan sa atin may kuwestiyon, bakit Lord, bakit ganun?' Pero darating 'yung time na 'yung mga katanungan natin masasagot din 'yan later on. 'Di natin alam kung kailanman, basta darating ang kasagutan sa tanong natin na 'yon,\u201d dagdag ni Sanchez. Ayon kay Sanchez, isang malaking biyaya niyang maituturing ang dami rin ng mga taong nagdasal para sa kanyang panggaling. \u201cNoong time na nagka-COVID ako, ang dami-dami nagdadasal. Tapos nagugulat ako na hindi ko mga kilala 'yung iba, nag-te-text, may nagpapa-text. 'Di ba blessing 'yon? Ni minsan hindi ako nagsalita na 'bakit, Lord?' ...Never naman ako iniwan ng Diyos. Ako ang nang-iwan sa Diyos. Tini-take for granted ko Siya. Maraming beses. Pero Siya tuloy-tuloy niya akong niyayakap. Never naman nang-iwan ang Diyos sa atin. Nandiyan lang Siya, naghihintay lang Siya kung kailan natin Siya tawagin siya at kailan natin siya i-embrace totally sa buhay,\u201d ani Sanchez.
