This raises the country’s total number of infections to 648,066. The day’s figure is considered the highest ever since the coronavirus outbreak hit the country, surpassing the previous record of 6,861 cases announced by the Department of Health (DOH) on Aug. 10 last year. Friday’s tally still does not include results from 5 accredited laboratories after failing to submit data on time. Active cases reached 73,264, with 97.3 percent of those still battling the disease experiencing mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. The ABS-CBN Investigative and Research Group also noted that the number of remaining active infections is the highest since Aug. 29. The number of active cases reported in previous days has been adjusted for duplicates, it added. The health department logged 13 more COVID-related deaths. The country’s death toll due to the virus stood at 12,900. Recoveries increased by 390 to 561,902.

Onda is set to be the first Filipino to explore Emden Deep, which is located in the Philippine Trench and approximately 34,100 feet deep. \"What we will see is initial observation, it\\'s just setting the record and trying to identify where the Emden Deep is.... Hopefully from those initial observations [that the government of the Philippines, the Filipino people will take more interest and hopefully would invest in more scientific endeavors in this region,\" he said. Onda, who works at the University of the Philippines’ Marine Science Institute, was invited by private organization Caladan Oceanic in the expedition set to happen from March 22 to 28. Joining him is undersea explorer Victor Vescovo, who holds the record for the deepest manned descent in the Mariana Trench in 2019. They will explore Emden Deep onboard the DSSV (deep submersible support vessel) Pressure Drop. The travel would take at least 10 hours, said Onda. To prepare for the historic attempt, Onda said he watched previous ocean explorations, accustomed himself being enclosed in a deep-sea submersible and \"not to be surprised when things could go wrong.\" \"It will be a privilege that when I come back, I will be teaching something that is not just from the textbooks,\" he said. \"It\\'s something that I have seen myself, I have experienced myself that not all people were able to experience. It is the Filipino people who will actually benefit from that and that\\'s what I\\'m hoping for,\" Onda added. The UP Marine Science Institute earlier touted the activity as a \"major record-setting scientific and historic achievement.\" “The Philippine Trench is a unique feature found within the EEZ of the Philippines, and it is only appropriate that a Filipino scientist be one of the first to hold this record in the Emden Deep,” it added.'},\n",

This, as the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on COVID-19 announced the 2-week closure of some industries in areas under general community quarantine, including Metro Manila, to help curb the spread of the virus. “The status quo is not enough. We need more mobility restrictions,” said Prof. Ranjit Rye of the OCTA Group during a virtual forum. “We are in a surge that is very different and is more serious than the last surge,” he said. The “Hard GCQ” suggested by the group includes discouraged social gatherings and indoor dining and a more significant work-from-home set-up for industries that can implement it. For workers who are still required to work outside, quarantine pass will be required and mass transportation should be available.

Dr. Guido David, who does the group’s COVID-19 projections, said that the number of cases is higher for the current surge but that the health sector is handling the situation better. However. Fr. Nicanor Austriaco pointed out that it will be challenging for hospitals as cases continue to increase due to the limited number of health care staff. Metro Manila, home to 12 million people, is under GCQ this March, along with 9 other areas.

       "  'content': 'MANILA — Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Friday they have received suggestions to recall and redistribute limited coronavirus jabs from provinces with low infection rates to high-risk areas or those hard-hit by the fresh virus surge. He identified National Capital Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, Calabarzon, Central Luzon, and Central Visayas as possible recipients of the vaccine supplies due to the number of cases in those areas. \"May mungkahi si [Marikina City] Mayor Marcy Teodoro na kung puwede ang mga bakuna sa mga lugar na mahina ang uptake [of vaccine] o mababa ang cases, baka pwede dalhin dito sa NCR, 4A, 3, 7 at CAR,\" Duque told reporters. (Mayor Teodoro suggested that we may want to redistribute supplies to areas with high number of COVID-19 cases.] Duque added the vaccines would only be \"borrowed.\" \"Ito’y hihiramin lang, hindi babawiin. Hindi mawawalan sila. Ito ay para makatulong makumpleto ang bakunahan ng ating priority group A,\" he said. (We would only borrow it. They won\\'t lose their supply.) Duque also said some hospitals in the provinces reported low vaccine turnout. Realigning the vaccine supply would prevent wastage, he said. “May mga ospital na mababa ang uptake. Una, hindi ito sapilitan. Voluntary. Ang iba ayaw pa. Hindi puwedeng maghintay tayo, masasayang ang bakuna. AZ (AstraZeneca) expiry period is May 31. Dapat nang ipagamit,” Duque explained. (Their are hospitals with low vaccine uptake. We can\\'t wait for them to decide because AztraZeneca jabs, for example, would expire on May 31. We need to use them.) But the League of Provinces of the Philippines (LPP) voiced their opposition to the proposed vaccine redeployment. Some local governments are still convincing their health care workers to get vaccinated, said LPP president Marinduque Governor Presbitero Velasco Jr. \"Hindi pa buo ang aming posisyon, pero ang pananaw namin, kailangan din namin ang mga bakuna. Kung talagang hindi gagamitin, itanong ang mga LGU if they want to return their vaccines,” Velasco told ABS-CBN News. (We have no official position yet, but we also need vaccines. The LGUs should be consulted about this.) He then continued, “Iba-iba ang mga sitwasyon ng mga province. Maaaring meron lang hindi nagpapabakuna pero ineengganyo pa. It’s best we ask local chief executives.” (Situation is different in every province. Some still have supply because their vaccine campaign is still ongoing.) Velasco added vaccine supply in the provinces is already limited as it is. \"Kakaunti lang din ang binigay na supply sa amin eh, so kulang na kulang pa \\'yun. Pero sa iba na may sobra, tanungin na lang sila if they are willing to let go of the vaccines,\" he explained. (We have minimal supply to begin with. For others with excess, better ask them if they are willing to let go of the vaccines.) Velasco urged the national government to consult with local government officials before implementing such plan. Asked to react to the LPP’s opposition, Duque answered: \"Papakiusapan ko. I will try my best, \\'yung mga mabababa ang active cases... Papakiusapan na lang na mataas talaga ang kaso sa NCR, nasa kalahati ng total cases natin.\" (I will convince them. The NCR is really hard hit by the virus, half of the cases is in the region.) Duque said he would call LPP as well as the Union of Local Authorities of the Philippines (ULAP), the umbrella organization of all local government units, to convince them to agree to the plan. The Philippines is battling a surge in coronavirus infections that has raised the total tally of cases to 640,984.

The Food and Drug Administration has previously held talks with American companies Johnson & Johnson and Moderna on the requirements for obtaining regulatory approval in the Philippines, FDA director-general Eric Domingo said in a press briefing. \"As of this date, we have not received an application for an EUA from Moderna,\" he said. \" Similar to Moderna... there\\'s no filing of EUA application from J&J.\" Domingo also said China\\'s Sinopharm had also yet to submit its application for EUA. \"As of now, wala pa talagang (there\\'s no) officially filed application with documents and requirements with the FDA when it comes to Sinopharm,\" he said. Domingo noted the FDA received 2 letters from different companies expressing intent to apply for EUA in the country. The agency has since responded to the letters, informing them of the requirements. Both firms have yet to respond. In February, President Rodrigo Duterte said he preferred to use COVID-19 shots from the Chinese state firm. Some members of his security detail also took unauthorized Sinopharm jabs last year. The FDA reiterated that an EUA would only be issued if the following circumstances are present: To date, only COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Sinovac and Gamaleya Institute have been approved in the Philippines for emergency use. Based on Phase 3 clinical trials, Johnson & Johnson\\'s vaccine was 66 percent effective against the disease while Moderna had an efficacy rate of 94 percent against symptomatic COVID-19. For Sinopharm, the company said its vaccine was found 72.5 percent effective against COVID-19, according to interim analysis. The country began its inoculation drive on March 1, with priority given to health care workers a day after it received COVID-19 doses donated by Sinovac.

The President is \"fit and healthy for a person his age,\" Roque had said. \"So far, he is okay. As far as I know there is no cancer. And as I have said if there is cancer and if it is a serious illness, he will be reporting it to the people,\" he said.

This as the administration saw a shutdown of a major broadcast network and arrests, prosecution and red tagging of journalists. The survey, conducted from Nov. 21 to 25 last year, also found that less than a fifth (16 percent) of Filipinos disagreed with the statement: “It is dangerous to print or broadcast anything critical of the administration, even if it is the truth.\" Meanwhile, 18 percent were undecided. The responses have a net agreement score of +49, considered by the pollster as \"strong.\" >EMBED CHART 1 HERE This net score increased by 28 points from the +21 reported in July 2020 which was \"moderate,\" it pointed out. Such sentiment was most prevalent in Mindanao, with a net agreement of +58. It was followed by Visayas with +55, Balance Luzon with +47, and Metro Manila with +30. Compared to the July 2020 poll, SWS said the net agreement \"rose sharply\" in Mindanao and in Visayas. The net agreement also increased in Balance Luzon and in Metro Manila. Belief that critical reporting on the Duterte administration is dangerous rose to +58 from +28 in Mindanao, and +55 from +26 in Visayas. It also rose from +16 to +47 in Balance Luzon and from +16 to +30 in Metro Manila. The release of the survey came almost a year since media network ABS-CBN was forced off the air after its franchise expiry— a promise Duterte had made in public speeches. Lawmakers from the House of Representatives eventually rejected its bid for a franchise renewal.

The efficacy rate of the vaccine, which comes in a 2-dose regimen administered 3 weeks apart, is consistent among all age groups 18 and older, he added. \"Based on the totality of evidence available to date, including data from adequate and well-known controlled trials, it is reasonable to believe that the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology Sputnik V Gam-Cov-Vac COVID-19 vaccine may be effective to prevent COVID-19,\" Domingo said. The potential benefits of the Sputnik V vaccine, he noted, also outweigh the known and potential risks of the Russian-developed shots. \"The adverse events reported were mostly mild and transient, similar to common vaccine reactions. No specific safety concerns were identified,\" Domingo said. The Philippines will start negotiating a supply deal for Sputnik doses next Tuesday, said vaccine \"czar\" Secretary Carlito Galvez. \"Ang initial request po namin is kung puwedeng makapag-deliver sila ng more or less 3 million doses this coming April, May,\" he said. (Our initial request is that they deliver more or less 3 million doses this coming April, May.) Authorities will also try to convince their Russian counterparts to allow Philippine local governments to procure Sputnik jabs, said Galvez. The Gamaleya Institute applied for emergency use of its experimental vaccine on Jan. 7. It later submitted results of its Phase 3 trials on Jan. 21. It marks the fourth vaccine to obtain regulatory approval in the Philippines after Pfizer-BioNTech on Jan. 14, AstraZeneca-Oxford on Jan. 28 and Sinovac on Feb. 22. Domingo said the Philippine Archipelago International Trading Corp. should supply the vaccine to emergency response stakeholders. The jabs, which are stored at -18 degree Celsius and below, shall be administered to healthy individuals aged 18 years and older. \"The good with the Sputnik V vaccine is that 25 percent of trial participants actually have comorbids [but] they also did quite well with the vaccine,\" he said. Domingo reiterated that the EUA was not a marketing authorization or a certificate of product registration. \"Hence, this EUA cannot be used as an authorization to market the vaccine commercially,\" he added. Russia approved the vaccine in August before its large-scale trial began, saying it was the first country to do so for a COVID-19 shot. It named it Sputnik V, in homage to the world’s first satellite, launched by the Soviet Union. Small numbers of frontline health workers began receiving it soon after and a large-scale roll out started in December, though access was limited to those in specific professions, such as teachers, medical workers and journalists. In January, the vaccine was offered to all Russians. In February, Galvez said the Philippines was planning to buy 20 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. He had said the initial delivery of the vaccines was set in April if regulators authorized it for emergency use. The Philippines rolled out its COVID-19 inoculation drive on March 1, much later than other countries. To date, nearly 241,000 out of 1.7 million health-care workers have been vaccinated. The country aims to vaccinate 70 million or two-thirds of its population by yearend to achieve herd immunity. - With a report from Reuters RELATED VIDEO'},\n",

His daughter, meanwhile, topped an electoral survey published in December last year. She, however, said she does \"not intend to run for President.\" \"The Philippines is not Davao City. If they can do that in Davao City, I don’t think the Filipinos are ready for a Davao City-like political situation or arrangement.

A group of experts have called on the government to focus their vaccination drive in the capital region as COVID-19 cases have increased in the past weeks. Metro Manila, home to about a tenth of the country\\'s population, is considered the epicenter of the health crisis. The region has tallied over 267,000 coronavirus cases, data from DOH as of March 18 showed. Duque said the Philippines was set to receive an additional 2.3 million COVID-19 vaccines from Sinovac and AstraZeneca through the vaccine-sharing COVAX Facility. The country launched its inoculation program on March 1, much later than many other countries. To date, over 240,000 anti-coronavirus jabs have reached the arms of health-care workers. The country aims to vaccinate all of its 1.7 million medical frontliners by April. The Philippines on Thursday logged 5,290 new coronavirus infections, the second highest daily tally this year, pushing the total number of cases to 640,984. COVID-19-related fatalities stood at 12,887.

       "  'content': 'MANILA - The Department of Agriculture has asked President Rodrigo Duterte to declare a state of emergency to prevent the further spread of African swine fever in the country. Once a state of emergency is declared, local government units are required to earmark funds to address the threat of the disease, Agriculture Assistant Secretary Noel Reyes told Teleradyo. It would also mandate concerned government agencies to address the problem, he added. The disease is harmless to humans but is deadly to pigs and there is no vaccine or cure. In a memorandum signed by Agriculture Secretary William Dar and submitted to Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, the agency on Wednesday drafted a proclamation to declare a state of emergency due to ASF. Dar said the disease had spread to 12 regions, 40 provinces, 466 cities and municipalities and 2,425 barangays. \"Over 3 million heads of pig have been lost due to the disease, causing contraction in pork supply and an unprecedented increase in the price of basic agricultural commodities,\" he said. The call came after a Senate panel recommended the declaration of state of emergency in the country due to the continuing threat of ASF. The DA has extended the implementation of price cap for pork and chicken until April 8 as the government continues to ease inflation. Duterte earlier issued an executive order imposing price cap on pork and chicken products in Metro Manila following public lament on the rising cost of these food items. Under the EO, the price cap for kasim and pigue was set at P270 per kilo, P300 for liempo, and P160 for dressed chicken per kilo. To augment domestic supply, Reyes said the agency also proposed increasing volume of pork imports to 400,000 metric tons. '},\n",

       "  'content': 'MANILA - The Department of Foreign Affairs on Thursday insisted the Philippines should form \"archipelagic sea lanes\" within the country\\'s waters for foreign vessels and aircraft. The DFA said in a Senate hearing on foreign relations that under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Philippines agreed to establish routes within its waters where foreign warships, submarines, aircraft can exercise non-suspendable navigation and overflights in their normal mode of operation \"without our consent.\" \"This is the compromise we made during the negotiations in the 3rd United Nations Conference on the Law of the Seas from 1973 to 1982 . . . in order for the archipelagos such as the Philippines to be treated as a single unit,\" said DFA Asec. Igor Bailen of the Office of Treaties and Legal Affairs. \"While UNCLOS allows user states to pass (through) archipelagic waters, it also provides the archipelagic state such as the Philippines right to designate only specific sea lanes where archipelagic sea lanes can be exercised.\" Bailen said that due to a lack of sea lanes, other countries are taking advantage of the situation every time their vessels pass through Philippine maritime waters. \"The routes normally used for international navigation has no precise definition under UNCLOS, and as such can be subject to varying interpretations by foreign countries in accordance to their own interests,\" said Bailen. \"In fact, this is exactly what China used to justify the passage of its warships over Sibutu passage between North Borneo and Sulu . . . therefore not designating ASLs (Archipelagic Sea Lanes) would allow foreign countries exercise archipelagic sea lanes passage in whatever route they consider or insist as routes normally used for international navigation,\" he emphasized. Under Senate Bill 1890, or \"An Act to Establish the archipelagic sea lanes in the Philippine Archipelagic waters,\" which is being pushed by Sen. Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III, foreign ships and aircraft will be obligated to follow Philippine maritime rules, such as prohibition of lingering in the country\\'s waters without force majeure or emergencies due to uncontrollable events. The DFA said Congress should handle the proposal to establish ASLs. Other groups have expressed their support for the proposition, including the UP Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea. \"This doesn\\'t necessarily affect the merchant marine traffic, but at least the military marine traffic can then be more rationally addressed with our limited resources,\" said UP Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea director Jay Batongbacal. At present, the Philippines has territorial disputes with China over the Spratly group of islands in the West Philippine Sea. China has made a number of aggressive moves in the contested region, including construction of military bases and missile tests, in what experts call as attempts to undermine the Philippines’ victory in a 2016 ruling on the South China Sea. The 2016 decision on the arbitration case by the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled the Philippines had exclusive sovereign rights of the area and invalidated China’s “nine-dash line” over it. -- Report from Jasmin Romero, ABS-CBN News RELATED VIDEO'},\n",

He earlier noted that Phase 3 clinical trials done in different countries showed that Sinovac\\'s vaccine has an efficacy rate of 65.3% based on trials in Indonesia, and up to 91.2% based on trials done in Turkey. The trials only involved adults aged 18 to 59 years. But according to vaccine czar and National COVID-19 Task Force chief implementer Sec.

Leila de Lima “bitch”, a term that he has often publicly used to describe women. At an anti-communist event, Duterte’s rambling speech touched on illegal drugs and he at one point brought up the death due to COVID-19 of convicted drug lord Jaybee Sebastian, who had accused De Lima of accepting payoffs when she was still justice secretary. The President, without presenting proof, said De Lima often spent “hours” at Sebastian\\'s “kubol.” “She is the only bitch na napaniwala ang mundo na she’s a prisoner of conscience,” Duterte said. (She is the only bitch who convinced the world she\\'s a prisoner of conscience.) “Binigyan pa ng mga award nitong mga loko-loko na Europeans. Kaya ako galit dyan. Hindi ako makipag-usap, ayoko.” (The crazy Europeans even gave her awards. That’s why I am angry with them, I don’t want to talk.) Bitch?

He\\'s merely diverting attention away from his failures.\" Several US senators and rights groups have called on the government to free De Lima, who has said the drug charges against her were politically motivated over her criticism of the killings under Dutete’s drug war, which his aides deny. Duterte in several instances has spawned allegations of sexism over his comments on women. Aside from De Lima, Duterte had addressed the female police and army staff at a 2019 event as “puta”, a derogatory term for a prostitute. He has also called UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings Agnes Callamard “son of a bitch” and \"stupid\". In November 2020, Duterte and other government officials joked about sex and womanizing during a post-typhoon briefing in calamity-hit Camarines Sur. This prompted a reminder from the Commission on Human Rights that the objectification of women is a form of violence. In January, Duterte said women were not fit to be president. Marking Women\\'s Month, Duterte on March 8 Duterte said the government can “proudly claim” that it took actions “to create an environment where women\\'s rights are respected and their contributions to society are recognized.”\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n“Let us elevate women to their rightful place in society by empowering every Filipina to break not only barriers that have long hindered them from reaching their full potential, but also the backward mindset that fueled a culture of gender oppression and inequality,” the President said in a statement.

Sa virtual hearing nitong Huwebes ng Senate Committee on Foreign Relations na pinamumunuan ni Sen. Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III, iginiit ni Lapid na kailangan ito ng mga senior citizen, lalo na\\'t karamihan sa mga ito ay mahihina na. \"\\'Yung mga senior citizen natin, karamihan diyan ay ‘di na makalakad, ‘di na makakita, malabo na ang mata. Kaya, pwede na sigurong pagbigyan,\" giit ni Lapid na nagpanukala ng Senate Bill No. 1197. Naghain din ang senador ng parehong panukalang batas noong 2019. Pero kung tatanungin ang Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), mahirap daw itong gawin dahil hindi ito akma sa international standards. “Our position is that the grant of the lifetime passport validity will not be compliant with the [International Civil Aviation Organization’s] specifications,” paliwanag ni DFA Office of Consular Affairs Executive Director Alnee Gamble. Dagdag ni Gamble, ang ICAO ay isang ahensya sa United Nations na naglalatag ng specifications para sa mga ini-isyu ng isang “machine readable travel document”, gaya ng pasaporte ng Pilipinas. BALIKAN: Imbes umanong makatulong, baka lalo pa itong maka-perwisyo sa mga senior citizen. “The issue there is the passport will become non-compliant, because it does not conform with the ICAO standards, and our senior citizens will have a problem when they cross borders,\" giit niya. Hindi naman kuntento dito si Sen. Francis Tolentino. Aniya, baka pwede itong gawan ng paraan para mabawasan ang mga kailangang asikasuhin ng mga senior citizens. “Perhaps, a method can be devised without violating our existing agreements, by just perhaps stamping or revalidating, in so far the 5 to 10 years requirement is concerned... We give respect and honor to our senior citizens by not burdening them administratively,” aniya. “in the short life span that they would have here on earth.. to outrightly suggest that what the good senator has done would be violative of the existing international regulations, is unfair,” dagdag ng senador. Pero ayon sa DFA, kailangan pa ring sundin ang panuntunan ng ICAO. Kung hindi umubra ang lifetime validity, minungkahi ni Pimentel na gawing libre na lang ang renewal ng passport. Hindi naman ito sinang-ayunan ni Sen. Pia Cayetano. \"At 60 years old, so many of these people are quite young and probably travel 20 times a year, have the liberty of traveling and spending money. I don\\'t see the point of making it free.. I have reservations for making it free just because they are of a certain age,\" paliwanag ni Cayetano. Plano ni Pimentel na isama ang naturang panukala sa bersyon ng Kamara, o ang House Bill No. 8530, na naglalayong i-update ang Philippine Passport Law.'},\n",

However you pick it, wala na eH, dementia or something,\" Duterte said in an anti-communism event in Tacloban City, Leyte. \"He keeps on transferring from one topic to another, that finally, I thought that peace, through negotiations sa kanilang liderato, hindi puwede. Nag-give up na ako. I tried everything.\" (Peace talks with their leaders is not feasible. I gave up.) \"Bata-bata ako ni Sison noon. When we were young... alam mo \\'yong ideyalismo, I used to participate in protest-protest until my father, nagalit.

When we were young, you know idealism, I used to join protests until my father got angry. So, I had to stop.) \"Fifty-three years after, wala akong nakitang na-achieve ng terorista.

He accused Duterte of following former US President Donald Trump\\'s order to terminate the peace negotiations \"in exchange for military assistance.\" Since coming to power in 2016, Duterte has seen his efforts to forge peace with communist rebels derailed repeatedly, prompting frequent outbursts and threats to wipe them out.\\xa0\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nEarlier this month, he told security forces to kill communist rebels and \"ignore human rights.\" Days after his remark, police raids left 9 activists dead, prompting concern from the United Nations rights council and the European Union. — With a report from Reuters'},\n",

Simula nang pumasok ang Marso, dumoble rin ang mga kaso ng COVID-19 sa Jose R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center. Tingin ng opisyal ng pagamutan, isa sa posibleng dahilan ng pagsipa ng kaso ay ang pananaw ng publiko sa pagdating ng mga bakuna sa bansa. \"Parang binibiro po yata ng tadhana na talagang nakipagsabay po sa pag-rollout ng ating bakuna...

Ayon kay Mayor Toby Tiangco, halos puno na ang mga ward ng ospital at nangangamba siyang hindi na kayanin ng mga health worker ang tuluyang pagdami ng mga pasyente. \"Puno na po halos ang mga ward sa ating ospital. Kung patuloy pa pong dadami ang mga nahahawahan ng COVID-19, baka hindi na po kayanin ng ating mga medical frontliner na tugunan ang pangangailangang medikal ng mga pasyente, lalo kung pati sila ay nagkakasakit na rin,\" ani Tiangco. Aminado ang Palasyo na nagiging kritikal na ang health care utilization rate sa Metro Manila. \"Isa po sa mga criterion para mapataas ang quarantine classification ay \\'yung health care utilization rate. Kapag umabot na po tayo sa danger, \\'yung red na tinatawag, that may be a ground to increase the quarantine classification. Pero meron naman po tayong One Hospital Command Center at sa aking mga narinig kay [treatment czar] Dr. [Leopoldo] Vega ay posible naman nating i-augment ang health care capacity natin sa Manila,\" sabi ni Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque.

       "  'content': 'Kasunod ng pagkamatay ng isang health worker na nabakunahan ng COVID-19 vaccine ng Sinovac, nilinaw ng National Adverse Events Following Immunization Committee (NAEFIC) na ang dahilan ng pagkamatay ay pagkakaroon ng COVID-19 at hindi ang bakuna. Noong isang taon, sinasabing nagkaroon na ng COVID-19 ang 47 taong gulang na health worker na may hypertension, diabetes, at bronchial asthma. Noong Pebrero 22, sumailalim ulit siya sa RT-PCR test kung saan positibo ang kaniyang resulta. Pero kinabukasan, Pebrero 23, nagpa-test ulit siya at lumabas na negatibo ang resulta. Marso 4 nang bakunahan ang naturang health worker ng Sinovac vaccine. Wala siyang sintomas ng kahit anong sakit noon. Makaraan ang 4 na araw, Marso 8, nalaman ng health worker na positibo siya ulit sa COVID-19. Na-admit siya sa ospital noong Marso 10 pero namatay makalipas ang 3 araw. Ayon kay Dr. Rommel Lobo ng NAEFIC, maaaring ang positibong resulta ng RT-PCR test noong Pebrero 22 ay remnants o latak lang ng coronavirus. Posible umanong nakuha ng health worker ang panibagong impeksiyon matapos mabakunahan. \"The patient might have been exposed to an individual she had encountered,\" ani Lobo. \"We know that there is certain period of incubation. She developed the symptom after vaccination. The vaccine does not have anything to do with the infection. The exposure is responsible for this,\" paliwanag ng doktor. Ayon naman kay Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo, naabisuhan na nila ang manufacturer ng bakuna ukol sa insidente. Naghihintay pa rin ang FDA ng impormasyon kung may katulad na pangyayari sa ibang bansa kung saan ipinamahagi ang Sinovac. Paalala naman ni Domingo: \"Kapag nabakunahan, hindi \\'yan magic na biglang hindi na po kayo puwedeng magkaroon ng COVID. It takes time and you have to give your body time to develop immunity.\" Sa datos ng FDA, nasa higit 7,000 adverse events na ang naire-report sa kanila para sa bakuna ng Sinovac at AstraZeneca. Mas marami umano ang itinuturing na non-serious kompara sa serious adverse event. Maituturing na seryoso ang isang adverse event kung matapos mabakunahan ay namatay o nalagay sa alanganin ang buhay ng naturukan, kung kailangan maospital, kung nagkaroon ng disability, at kung nagdulot ng birth defect sa anak ng nabakunahang buntis. Ang malinaw sa ngayon, ayon sa Department of Health, hindi kailangang itigil ang pagbabakuna kontra COVID-19. \"The vaccine was not the one that caused the death of our health care worker,\" ani Dr. Beverly Ho ng DOH. Dahil sa patuloy na pagtaas ng kaso ng COVID-19, lalo sa National Capital Region (NCR), kasabay ng pautay-utay na rollout ng bakuna, iminungkahi ng OCTA Research Group na baka mas makatulong kung ang mga paparating na bakuna ay maipamahagi muna sa mga lugar na may pagdami ng mga kaso. \"While we understand that there is a need to prioritize our health workers, at the same time we are dealing right now with a serious surge in NCR and this is also occurring in parts of Calabarzon,\" ani Guido David ng OCTA Research Group. Ayon kay David, ang pagbabakuna sa malaking porsiyento ng mga nasa NCR ay magkakaroon pa rin ng positibong epekto sa bilang ng kaso sa iba pang rehiyon. Sa huling projection ng grupo, nakita nilang seryoso na ang surge ng kaso ng COVID-19 sa NCR. Sa 25 local government unit na may pinakamaraming naitalang kaso mula Marso 10 hanggang 16, 15 ay nasa NCR. Tumaas na rin sa 1.96 ang reproduction number, ang pinakamataas na inabot ng reproduction number mula Mayo noong isang taon. – Ulat ni Raphael Bosano, ABS-CBN News'},\n",

       "  'content': 'MANILA (UPDATE) - A coalition of different groups, led by former high-ranking officials of the country, was launched Thursday to seek a single slate of national candidates in the 2022 elections to counter the Duterte administration\\'s bets. There should only be one \"pro-democracy opposition candidate\" to avoid dividing the votes of those who do not agree with the current administration, the group 1Sambayan said. Leading the coalition, which was formally launched in Makati, are retired Justice Antonio Carpio, former Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales, and former Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert Del Rosario, among others. The three former officials have been vocal against President Rodrigo Duterte\\'s policy on the South China Sea. \"The Filipino people deserve a better government,” said Carpio, 1Sambayan Chairman, according to a statement of the group. \"1Sambayan believes coming together as one will prevent a repeat of the scenario in 2016, when a president won by a plurality but not a majority of votes,\" the group said. \"It is, then, just a matter of choosing that one candidate for each national position,\" it added. The group\\'s convenors said they are looking to endorse a candidate who has a clean track record, an upright stand on key issues, platforms that address the country\\'s current problems, \"recall among the voting population... and the verve to compete with other candidates for the people’s votes.\" 1Sambayan said it would \"conduct their own online survey and take into account other surveys by reputable organizations to gauge the winnability of the aspiring candidates.\" The coalition’s convenors will create a shortlist of possible candidates and \"thoroughly interview each aspirant and examine their eligibility and qualifications for office,\" the group\\'s statement read. President Rodrigo Duterte\\'s daughter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, and PDP-Laban acting president Manny Pacquiao would not be included in the shortlist, Del Rosario told reporters. The group \\'rejects\\' candidates who are supportive of Duterte\\'s authoritarian policies, he said, when asked if 1Sambayan would consider backing the two. \"The Filipino people should reject all those identified with dictatorship and authoritarianism, reject all those responsible for or who abet extrajudicial killings and whose mantra is \\'kill, kill, kill,\\' and all those who violate human rights,\" he said. Duterte had said in 2018 that he had to be a \"dictator\" to put the country in order, and that his “only sin” was extrajudicial killings. Early this month, he also directed government troops to \"ignore\" human rights when they carry out his order to shoot dead armed communist rebels during encounters. Amid the criticisms, Duterte had been getting high approval and satisfaction ratings in surveys conducted by some pollsters, with a Pulse Asia survey in September last year showing that 91 percent of Filipinos approve of his performance in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. A Social Weather Stations survey in December 2019 also revealed that the administration scored an \"excellent\" or net satisfaction rating of +73 at the time. During the 2019 mid-term elections, nine senatorial candidates endorsed by Duterte and three independents won. None from the opposition slate made it. DUTERTE-CARPIO AND PACQUIAO REACTIONS Duterte-Carpio, who had repeatedly stated she is not running for the Presidency in 2022, slammed 1Sambayan\\'s statement, saying the coalition is sowing disunity. \"They claim to be a coalition of democratic forces but they reject so many who do not agree with them. They sound authoritarian to me,\" said the chair of the regional alliance Hugpong ng Pagbabago. \"Kung gusto nila maging successful, dapat ang panawagan nila ay magkaisa. What this country needs is unity, not messages with the word reject,\" she said. (If they want to be successful, they should call for unity. What this country needs is unity, not messages with the word reject.) Pacquiao, for his part, stuck with his recent pronouncements as he reiterated that \"this is not the best time to talk about these political line-ups.\" Some members of the ruling political party have signed a resolution earlier this month asking Duterte to run for Vice President in 2022, a move Pacquiao declared to be illegitimate. Last week, Duterte said his longtime aide, Sen. Christopher \"Bong\" Go, had told him of his desire to be President. The lawmaker said it was just a joke, but he said he might change his mind if Duterte decides to run for Vice President. Meanwhile, political analyst Ramon Casiple said 1Sambayan\\'s launch has signaled the start of the \"election season\" heading to the 2022 polls. He said that even if the group has yet to name its candidates it is clear with its intent to meet head on any candidate the administration might field. \"Political people na ito, kahit sabihin a Supreme Court justice sila before, the fact na lumitaw sila sa ganyang context... naghihintay na ako d\\'yan na may sasabihin silang pangalan ng kandidato later. Yung iba dyan may bibira sa kanila, hindi maiiwasan yan e. Season na,\" said Casiple. \"Ang eleksyon natin isang taon iyan. Napapanahon na para simulan na magusap usap para sa pulitika.\" When asked what 1Sambayan must do to succeed against an administration-backed candidate, Casiple said it should field only one presidential bet. \"Dapat isang kandidato lang. Kasi kung sila sila maghiwahiwalay. Sigurado magkakaproblema agad. Kung isa lang ang kalaban ng administrasyon, mas malaki ang tsansa,\" he said. - with reports from Katrina Domingo and RG Cruz, ABS-CBN News RELATED VIDEO'},\n",

       "  'content': 'MAYNILA (UPDATE) — Kinuwestiyon ng isang senador nitong Huwebes ang gagawing 1,500 cap sa bilang ng mga papayagang umuwing overseas Filipino workers (OFW) sa bansa kada araw. Sa bagong guidelines na inilabas ng pandemic task force ng bansa, tanging mga OFW lang muna ang papapasukin sa Pilipinas mula Marso 18 hanggang Abril 19. Nasa 1,500 kada araw lang mula sa dating 3,000 ang papapasukin para hindi agad mapuno ang mga pinagdadalhan sa kanila na mga quarantine facility. Sakaling sumobra sa 1,500 ang bilang ng mga papasok na pasahero, airlines na ang mananagot o magmumulta. Sabi ni Senate labor committee chairman Sen. Joel Villanueva, ang paglalagay ng limitasyon ay tila pag-amin umano ng gobyerno na hindi gumagana ang quarantine, testing at contact tracing program nito. \"Parang limang Airbus 350 lang ang gusto nating lumapag sa NAIA kada araw. Parang ang gusto nating mangyari ay padaanin sa imbudo ang ating mga kababayan. \\'Yun pong mga naipit sa lockdown dito sa atin, ilang araw lang na hindi makauwi sa bahay nila, balisang-balisa na. Paano pa \\'yung nasa ibang bansa ka?\" ani Villanueva sa pagdinig ng Senado ukol sa panukalang pagtatatag ng Department of Overseas Filipinos o DOFIL. \"Ang importante po ay testing, quarantine, at pag-aralan kung paano pa mapapalaki ang available na pondo ng OWWA (Overseas Workers Welfare Administration),\" dagdag ng senador. Sinabi ni OWWA Administrator Hans Leo Cacdac nitong Huwebes ng umaga na hihingi sila ng supplemental budget para sa repatriation ng mga OFW. Nasa P9.5 bilyon ang kanilang request na dagdag-pondo. Nabuo ang computation na ito mula sa average na 2,000 OFW na umuuwi araw-araw, o 60,000 sa isang buwan. Kasama sa budget ang gastos sa hotel accommodation na nasa 7 hanggang 9 araw at maximum rate na P3,000 kada gabi. Kaya suhestiyon ng mga senador, gamitin ang contingency fund ng OWWA sa halip na naghahagilap sila ng pondo para sa repatriation sa susunod na 8 buwan. Pero sabi ng Department of Budget and Management, hindi puwedeng galawin ang mga contingency fund dahil nakalaan ito sakaling kailanganin ng bagong bubuuing department. Sagot naman ni Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, ang repatriation ang top priority ng gobyerno at isang opsiyon lamang ang pagpondo sa DOFIL mula sa contingency fund. \"We will not reserve the contingency fund for the creation of the department, that\\'s very clear in the bill,\" aniya. Banggit pa niya, pag-uusapan ngayon ang solusyun sa problema. \\'MALAKING NEGATIBONG EPEKTO\\' Sa panayam sa Teleradyo, ibinahagi ni Villanueva ang pagkadismaya sa desisyon na ito ng gobyerno dahil malaki daw ang negatibong epekto nito sa mga OFW na gustong umuwi sa bansa. Aniya, sabik umuwi ang mga OFW, at buwan nila itong pinlano sa kabila ng pandemya pero baka maharang lang sila sa airport. \"Napakalaking negative effect... \\'Yung ating mga kababayan, salat sa pananalapi \\'yan. Talagang hard-earned money po talaga yan... \\'pag magbu-book \\'yan, about 6 months to 1 year ang preparation niyan \\'pag kukuha ng off \\'yan sa trabaho. Then all of a sudden, eto, bawal na hindi ka na makakapunta,\" paliwanag niya. Nababahala rin ang senador dahil baka maging apektado na rin ang pagpapauwi sa mga itinuturing na \"distressed\" returning OFWs bunsod ng naturang polisiya. \"To be determined by DFA and OWWA, wala pa pong kinalaman kung paano ipa-prioritize \\'yon ng DFA and OWWA. Lahat naman ng umuuwi [na OFWs] ngayong pandemya distressed po yan, paano yan ipa-prioritize?\" aniya. \"It\\'s a bad taste in the mouth na sabihan natin ang mga bagong bayani na \\'sige padala na lang kayo pero sasalain namin nang husto kung sino lang ang puwedeng umuwi fito sa inyong bayan na sinilangan.\\'\" — May ulat ni Robert Mano, ABS-CBN News RELATED VIDEO: '},\n",

Ito ang inihayag ni Marinduque Gov. Presbitero Velasco, Jr., pinuno ng League of Provinces of the Philippines (LPP), ngayong papalapit na ang Semana Santa kung kailan inaasahang marami ang uuwi sa mga probinsiya mula Kamaynilaan, na, nitong mga huling linggo, ay nakitaan ng pagdami ng bagong COVID-19 cases. Naaalarma umano ang ilang LGUs na baka tumaas din ang kaso sa kanilang mga lugar. \"\\'Yung hinihingi naming testing upon arrival, yun naman ay discretionary sa LGU. Kung gusto nilang mag-test ng sarili nila, okay. Kung ayaw naman nila, walang testing, okay din,\" ani Velasco. Noong Pebrero 27, inaprubahan ng IATF ang \"unified travel protocols\" para sa lahat ng LGUs, kung saan hindi na \"mandatory\" ang COVID-19 testing at pag-quarantine ng mga lokal na biyahero sa bansa. Kabilang ang LPP sa mga bumuo ng bagong alituntunin. “Hindi na po required na sumailalim sa COVID-19 testing ang isang biyahero, liban na lang kung ang LGU of destination ay humingi ng testing bago ang biyahe. Ang testing ay limitado lang sa RT-PCR test,” ani Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque nang i-anunsyo ang bagong patakaran. Ang pagka-quarantine naman ay ipatutupad lamang sa mga nagpapakita ng sintomas ng COVID-19 pagkarating sa kanilang destinasyon, aniya. Walang pagtutol ang Department of the Interior and Local Government sa pinakahuling pahayag ng LPP. \"The DILG has no objection with the proposal of LPP because it falls within the ambit of IATF Reso 101. It\\'s still discretionary on the LGU to require a test,\" ani DILG Spokesperson Jonathan Malaya. Kung papayagan ang hinihinging test upon arrival, ipauubaya ang desisyon sa mga LGU kung anong klaseng COVID-19 test ang gagamitin, at kung sino ang magbabayad nito. Nanawagan ang DILG sa mga lokal na pamahalaan ng mas maghigpit pa na pagpapatupad ng health protocols at pagkakaroon ng disiplina ng mga tao. \"More intensive implementation of the minimum health standards, individual discipline, indvidual responsibilty po sana ang ating gawin. Ibig sabihin, kung hindi naman kailangan ang biyaheng \\'yan, stay at home,\" sabi ni Malaya. Samantala, kani-kaniya namang pagsasaayos ng public health protocols ang ilang probinsiya. Kung papasok ng Iloilo, dapat magpakita ng negatibong RT-PCR test result na hindi lalagpas ng 72 oras ang validity, maliban na lang kung authorized person outside residence (APOR). Ang General Santos City naman, aalisin ang quarantine period sa pagpasok sa lungsod at hihingin na lang ang negatibong RT-PCR result. Suportado ng Department of Tourism ang mga paiiraling patakaran ng mga lokal na pamahalaan. \"Admittedly, ang Holy Week at lalo na ang summer, doon talaga yung mga nagbabakasyon ang ating mga kababayan. Doon talaga bumabawi ang turismo. Pero, given the pandemic, yung goals kasi ng Department of Tourism, palagi naman is the gradual and cautious resumption of tourism activities,\" ani Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat. Babala ng DOT na dapat sumunod sa health protocols ang mga turista at dapat accredited nila ang mga establisimyento na magbubukas. Nanawagan ang LPP na aksyunan ang panawagan nila sa lalong madaling panahon para mapaghandaan na ang dagsa ng mga pauwi sa iba\\'t ibang probinsiya. -- Ulat ni Raya Capulong, ABS-CBN News'},\n",

       "  'content': 'MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday urged Filipinos to learn from history and \"never again allow any other tribe to compromise our sovereignty,\" as he marked the 500th anniversary of the landing of the Spanish expedition in the Philippines. Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan and his crew landed in the Philippines on March 16, 1521, in the first circumnavigation of the world. He died on the shores of Mactan, Cebu, in a battle with chieftain Lapu-Lapu, which Duterte called \"an exemplary display of firm leadership and extraordinary courage defeated and drove away the colonials.\" Duterte said \"history should make us reflect on the past and look beyond our future.\" \"I therefore call on our kababayans to appreciate our rich history and learn from the experience of those that came before us so that we may never again allow any other tribe to compromise our sovereignty,\" the President said. Duterte led the unveiling of a marker in Guiuan, Samar for the 500th anniversary of Magellan\\'s global voyage. Some historical accounts say he first landed in Homonhon, an island in Guiuan. \"We thank everybody, the ancestors of the Spaniards who came here. And we hope that this event goes further—fortify our relations with the Spaniards,\" Duterte said. After Magellan\\'s death, further Spanish expeditions ended in disaster before Miguel López de Legazpi established the first permanent Spanish settlement in Cebu in 1565. Colonizers eventually converted most of the country to Roman Catholicism, except for the Moros of Mindanao. Duterte, the first President from Mindanao, rejected in 2019 a celebration for Magellan’s arrival, which he said heralded 300 years of Spanish rule and abuse against Filipinos. \"You know they came to our country as imperialist. Hindi man tayo Español (we are not Spanish) and they subjugated us for 300 years,” Duterte had said during a housing-related event in Cebu. About 80 percent of Filipinos are Catholics. Over the weekend, Pope Francis led a mass celebrating 500 years of Christianity in the Philippines.'},\n",

According to the Food and Drug Administration, 2.21 percent of those who received Sinovac\\'s CoronaVac experienced suspected side effects, and it was 5.19 percent for those inoculated with AstraZeneca\\'s product. FDA Director General Eric Domingo showed a breakdown of the reported “adverse events following immunization” (AEFI) in a media briefing, 18 days into the country\\'s COVID-19 vaccine rollout. FDA Dir. Gen. releases breakdown so far of adverse events following immunization for the CoronaVac (Sinovac) and AstraZeneca vaccines. There is 1 death under CoronaVac. (Note: AEFIs undergo investigation for causality since not all are actually caused by vaccination) @ABSCBNNews pic.twitter.com/j9IhgGPQbx  CORONAVAC Out of the 167,798 people vaccinated with CoronaVac, as of 6 p.m. of March 17, there were 3,700 who reported having suspected side effects. Of those, 83 are considered serious while one fatality was reported, referring to the death of a 47-year-old female health worker which has already been deemed unrelated to vaccination. There were also 46 recipients who reported respiratory symptoms such as cough and nasal congestion; 32 had allergic reactions; 31 had headache or other neurological symptoms; and 28 had such usual vaccination symptoms as pain, chills and fatigue. Other reported AEFIs were increased heart rate, abdominal pain, and body pain. Dr. Rommel Lobo, vice chair of the National Adverse Events Following Immunization Committee (NAEFIC), said that not all AEFIs are related to vaccines. Some may not have a connection at all, but will have to be reported, he said. ASTRAZENECA For the AstraZeneca vaccine, 3,715 of the 72,499 who have since received it reported suspected adverse events. Of those, 54 were considered serious. Most of the symptoms reported were pain, chills, fatigue, dizziness, headache, cough, nasal congestion and other common vaccination reactions. Domingo said the reported adverse events following immunization for CoronaVac and AstraZeneca vaccines are similar. @ABSCBNNews pic.twitter.com/hL6Mq5wZNI  “So far, wala naman tayong nakita na anything unusual,” Domingo said, adding that the death reported was already investigated on with a conclusion it was due to COVID-19 infection. Domingo said the 3.11 percent AEFI rate among the country\\'s vaccine recipients so far is within the accepted range because, according to him, in clinical trials where AEFI monitoring is more pro-active, 20% to 30% of vaccine recipients report side effects. Below is the regional breakdown of the suspected adverse reactions, as reported: The FDA also released the regional breakdown of suspected adverse reactions after vaccination (as of March 17, 6pm). pic.twitter.com/Qc3lIQ3MBH  Domingo said AstraZeneca assured the FDA during a meeting that the reported blood clot cases in Europe are unrelated to its vaccine candidate. The World Health Organization said that while it noted the temporary suspension on the use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in some countries in the European Union as a precautionary measure based on reports of rare blood coagulation disorders in persons who had received it, the international body still recommends that vaccinations continue as it considers that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. Domingo said the FDA receives reports of suspected side effects daily. Minor side effects must be reported within a week, while the serious ones must be relayed to them or the AEFI committee within 24 hours, he said. Both Domingo and Lobo reminded the public that even after vaccination, those inoculated should still follow health protocols since vaccine protection is not 100% and it takes time for the body to produce antibodies. \"\\'Pag po kayo nabakunahan, \\'di ka pa magkakaroon ng protection at immunity from COVID-19. For the first three or four weeks, ang possibility mo na magkaroon ng COVID ay kapareho ng mga \\'di nabakunahan. Kaya kailangan magiingat pa rin po tayo,\" Domingo said in an interview with ABS-CBN\\'s TeleRadyo. The Philippines has received 525,600 doses from AstraZeneca and 600,000 doses from Sinovac.'},\n",

The additional cases is the 5th highest daily tally since the start of the pandemic, according to the ABS-CBN Data Analytics Team. Eight laboratories failed to submit their results on time, the Department of Health said. Active cases stood at 66,567 or 10.4% of the cumulative total cases, the highest in 6 months or since September 19 last year. For the last 7 days, new cases have been more than 4,000. Analysts have attributed this to the surge in cases in Metro Manila and nearby provinces like Bulacan and those in Calabarzon, due to increased mobility of people, non-compliance with health protocols, and the presence of more transmissible COVID-19 variants. There are 21 new COVID-19 related deaths reported, raising the total fatalities to 12,887, which accounts for 2.01 percent of the cumulative total cases. Total recoveries went up by 439 to 561,530. Of those currently battling the disease, 93.3% have mild symptoms, 3.7% are asymptomatic, 1.2% are in critical condition, 1.2% have severe symptoms, and 0.64% have moderate symptoms. Meanwhile, 4 cases, 2 tagged as recovered, were removed from the official tally for being duplicate entries. There were also 6 recovered cases that turned out to be deaths. The OCTA Group on Wednesday said that the increase of COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila was a “serious surge.” But while many parts of the region and other provinces continue to record an increase in cases, there were also areas that had a slowing down of the spread of infection. The group said its projections may be lower if localized lockdowns and other measures work. The Philippines is currently rolling out its COVID-19 vaccines to health workers. As of March 17, more than 240,000 health workers have been vaccinated. There are 49.8 million people currently infected with COVID-19 worldwide.

In a statement, DILG Spokesperson Jonathan Malaya said the department has deployed 802 more contact tracers, including police officers and firefighters. He added that these will aid the 300 additional contact tracers already deployed by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority and those hired by local government units. \"That’s a total of 802 contact tracers from the DILG and 300 from the MMDA.

Malaya said the addition of new contact tracers was enough to aid local government units in meeting contact tracing standards. “With our number of CTs, we have exceeded DOH standard. Per the DOH, the ideal contact tracer to population ratio is 1:800 so to fully cover 108 million Filipinos, we actually need a total of 135,000 contact tracers only,” he said. “So wala po tayong dapat ipangamba.

In a statement released Wednesday, Cabral said, \"We are not back to square one. We are ten steps back from square one,\" as she recalled the challenges, especially of the health sector, when the country first confronted the pandemic. The Philippines is facing a surge in coronavirus cases and hospitals are under strain again, Cabral said. The Philippine economy also posted a -9.5 percent growth last year, its deepest slump since 1947. Officials and analysts attribute the current surge in COVID-19 cases to increased mobility of people, non-compliance with health protocols, and the presence of more transmissible COVID-19 variants. Some local governments, including in Metro Manila, have since revived some restrictive measures, including imposition of curfew. Foreigners and non-OFWs will also be temporarily barred from entering the country starting March 20 to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Cabral, who served as health chief during the the term of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, lamented the government\\'s response to COVID-19 had been slow. \"Sana ay mas naging mabilis ang response natin at mas malawak. Palagay ko ay \\'yan ang naging problema natin,\" she told TeleRadyo. (We could have been faster in our response, and covered more. I think that was our problem.) \"Marami tayong kakulangan sa contact tracing, border control at ngayon ay sa vaccine rollout,\" she added, even as Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said last week that the government showed \"excellent\" management of the COVID-19 pandemic. (We have deficiency in terms of contact tracing, border control and now, the vaccine rollout.) The country launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive on March 1, much later than many other countries, a day after Sinovac doses donated by China arrived in Manila. To date, over 240,000 anti-coronavirus jabs have reached the arms of healthcare workers. The Philippines aims to vaccinate all of its 1.7 million medical frontliners by April, according to vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. \"Assuming that there is a steady supply of vaccines, \\'pag ang speed ng vaccination ay katulad ngayon (if the speed of the vaccination is the same as now), it will take us more than 12 years bago matapos \\'yong 70 million (before we finished the 70 million),\" Cabral said. She said the government has to speed up the inoculation by 17 times to vaccinate two-thirds of the population by year-end. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III recently said Wednesday that the government aims to vaccinate daily some 450,000 against COVID-19 by next month as additional shots are expected to arrive. As regards contact tracing, Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said Thursday that the country\\'s capacity remains strong, having 255,854 tracers, \"which is more than sufficient for the country\\'s needs.\" According to the Department of the Interior and Local Government, there are 29,611 contact tracing teams nationwide, each composed of the municipal/city health officer and members of the Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams, volunteers from Civil Society Organizations, and augmentation from the DILG. Additional contact tracers have been deployed in Metro Manila amid the spike in new cases, said Malaya. Asked if her remark is harsh to government, Cabral, said: \"\\'Yan ang palagi kong sinasabi sa mga kasama ko sa DOH dati (This is what I always say to my colleagues before in DOH).

The Supreme Court on Tuesday unanimously scrapped the petitions challenging Duterte\\'s withdrawal from the ICC, for being \"moot and academic.\" This decision recognizes that Duterte is the chief architect of foreign policy, said his spokesman Harry Roque. \"Dahil dito nanawagan kami sa ICC na huwag nang magsayang ng panahon sa kanilang mga imbestigasyon dahil hindi kinikilala ng Pilipinas ang hurisdiksyon ng ICC,\" he said in a press briefing. \"Patunay rin ito na gumagana ang ating mga prosesong legal kaya tama lamang na tigilan na ang pakikialam ng ICC sa ating domestic affairs,\" he added. (Because of this, we ask the ICC to refrain from wasting time with their investigation because the Philippines does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC. This is also proof that our legal processes work so it is only right for ICC to stop its interference with our domestic affairs.) ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda in December found \"reasonable basis\" to believe that Duterte\\'s war on drugs has spawned crimes against humanity. In turn, Roque and Duterte\\'s chief legal counsel Salvador Panelo accused the prosecutor of politicking. Bensouda\\'s office opened in February 2018 a preliminary probe into the slay of thousands of suspected drug users and peddlers in the Philippines, including those killed for allegedly resisting arrest or were allegedly gunned down by law enforcers disguised as vigilantes.\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\nShe said she found \"reasonable basis to believe\" that crimes against humanity such as murder, torture and the infliction of serious physical injury and mental harm were committed under the drug war from July 2016 to mid-March 2019. She said the COVID-19 pandemic and \"capacity constraints\" delayed her office\\'s goal to conclude its preliminary examination of Duterte\\'s drug war. Duterte and his aides have repeatedly denied rights violations in the drug war, saying drug suspects were killed because they resisted arrest. He also repeated his accusation that rights defenders are \"preoccupied\" with the life of criminals, his advice for law enforcers to shoot suspects who fight back, and his promise to take responsibility for deaths in operations. Government data showed about 5,000 have died in anti-drug operations. Various rights groups are saying though that thousands more have been slain in alleged extrajudicial killings. Last month, Justice Secretary Menardo Gueverra told the Human Rights Council that \"in more than half of the records reviewed, the law enforcement agents involved failed to follow standard protocols pertaining to coordination with other agencies and the processing of the crime scene.\"'},\n",

Batid ni Gacutan, 76, taga-Quezon City, na bawal siyang lumabas ng bahay ngayong pandemya dahil mas delikado ang mga gaya niyang senior citizen sa COVID-19. Pero sa isang taong pagbabawal, inip na umano siya sa bahay dahil nag-iisa lang din siya sa buhay. \"Wala akong magawa. Wala akong kausap. Puro pusa ang kausap ko,\" ani Gacutan. Kaya bawal man, hindi napipigilan si Gacutan na makipagkita sa mga kaibigan para gampanan ang tungkulin bilang mandarasal. \"Siyempre, masarap ang pakiramdam. Kaya lang, mahirap pa rin. Napakahirap ng buhay,\" aniya. Ayon sa South Triangle Senior Citizen Association Inc.

Lumalabas lang diyan lang sa harapan [ng bahay],\" ani South Triangle Senior Citizen Association Inc. President Carmen Bustillo. Sa utos ng Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, bawal lumabas ang senior citizens maliban kung mamimili ng mga pangunahing pangangailangan, nangangailangan ng atensiyong medikal, o may trabaho sa mga pinapayagang industriya.

Ayon sa World Health Organization, ilan sa maaaring gawin ng mga senior citizen ang pag-eehersisyo, pag-inom ng maraming tubig, pagkain ng masustansiya, pag-iwas sa bisyo, at pag-aaral ng mga bagong pagkakaabalahan. \"Huwag natin silang pigilang magtrabaho, lalong-lalo na kung sila lolo at lola ay malakas pa o \\'yong tinatawag nating healthy elderly,\" ani Villalon.

Nauna nang sinabi ni vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. na tinitingnan ng gobyerno ang posibilidad na bakunahan ang mga senior citizen gamit ang COVID-19 vaccine ng Sinovac, kasunod ng pagbabakuna sa mga health workers ng bansa.

       "  'content': 'MANILA - A scientist from the University of the Philippines is set to be the first Filipino to reach what is called the \"3rd deepest spot on earth,\" the UP Marine Science Institute announced Wednesday. Microbial oceanographer Dr. Deo Florence L. Onda is set to become one of the first humans and the first Filipino to reach Emden Deep, located in the Philippine Trench and approximately 10,400 meters or 34,100 feet deep. The UP Marine Science Institute touted this as a \"major record-setting scientific and historic achievement\" calling it \"only appropriate\" that a Filipino scientist holds the record. \"Deep sea expeditions like this one are equivalent to the first early flights into outer space, thus it would be a major record-setting scientific and historic achievement. To date, most of these records are held by foreign scientists or explorers,” the UP Marine Science Institute said in a statement. “The Philippine Trench is a unique feature found within the EEZ of the Philippines, and it is only appropriate that a Filipino scientist be one of the first to hold this record in the Emden Deep,” it added. Onda, who is also MSI\\'s Deputy Director for Research, was invited by private organization Caladan Oceanic in the expedition set to happen from March 22 to 28, and will be joined by Victor Vescovo, who holds the record for the deepest manned descent in the Marianas Trench in 2019. Vescovo is also the main sponsor of Caladan Oceanic. Onda and Vescovo will dive the Emden Deep onboard the DSSV Pressure Drop, described by the MSI as the only marine vessel in the world with the capacity to launch a submersible that can transport humans and “repeatedly dive to the deepest parts in the world’s oceans.” They also plan to wave the Philippine Flag during the voyage to highlight it being “an integral part of our nation’s heritage.” Onda, through the voyage, will be given a chance to ride state of the art vessels capable of deep-sea activities. The MSI also saw this as an opportunity inspire young Filipinos to pursue marine science protection and conservation. “This endeavor can spark interest and passion for many other young Filipinos who would want to make a career in the sciences and bring more attention to the protection, preservation, and conservation of the Philippine marine environment,” MSI said in the statement. Onda has been onboard the DSSV Pressure Drop and is bound for the Philippine Trench from the Port of Guam by the time the press release was published.  IN OTHER NEWS:'},\n",

He was also seen participating in a mass gathering in Cebu last December. Nograles, also co-chairperson of the inter-agency task force (IATF) against COVID-19, said public officials are accountable to the Civil Service Commission and other laws, where they can be made liable for civil, criminal, and administrative complaints. They can also face charges from the Ombudsman for graft cases, he said. \"Lahat yan, the measures, the mechanism is there in place...Anybody can file a case against any public official they feel is breaking the law or not following protocols,\" he said. Nograles was also asked in the interview about what exactly are the rules about isolation and quarantine facilities, after an online article alleged Roque was staying at a posh hotel in Pasay City. The cabinet secretary said he personally does not know where Roque is currently staying. \"Siguro (Maybe) it’s best that we give him the opportunity to respond because personally I don’t know where he is currently isolated right now,\" he said.

       "  'content': 'MANILA — The Department of Health on Thursday said it won’t be changing its vaccination protocol after a health worker died from COVID-19 more than a week after she was vaccinated. “At this point in time there are no changes to our protocol,” said Dr. Beverly Ho, director of the Health Promotion Bureau and Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the DOH, a day after the DOH announced that its expert committee on adverse events concluded that the COVID-19 vaccine had nothing to do with the death of the health worker. The health worker, a 47-year-old woman who had COVID-19 in 2020, was vaccinated with Sinovac’s CoronaVac vaccine on March 4. According to the National Adverse Events Following Immunization Committee (NAEFIC), her comorbidities were diabetes, hypertension and bronchial asthma. Dr. Rommel Lobo, vice chair of the NAEFIC, said the woman tested positive again for COVID-19 through a PCR test on February 22 but tested negative the day after. Because of this, the positive test on February 22 was deemed remnants of her infection last year. Lobo said the woman did not have any symptoms when she was vaccinated on March 4. But on March 8, she tested positive for COVID-19. \"She was advised admission but she refused,” he said. On March 10, the health worker was admitted to the hospital. “Unfortunately she died on March 13 of COVID-19 infection,” Lobo said. Experts earlier said people who were infected with COVID-19 must wait 2 to 3 months before getting vaccinated. Lobo said it was not a problem for the health worker since she was infected last year and it had already been at least 6 months. “The patient might have been exposed to an individual she had encountered and then she might be incubating or having asymptomatic symptoms at the time that she was vaccinated,” Lobo said. In a separate phone interview with ABS-CBN News, Lobo said the woman might have gotten sick from a different strain, which was why she was re-infected even after surviving COVID the year before. However, he said it would be hard to check if this was the case. Ho said that they won’t do COVID-19 testing prior to vaccination as part of the screening, as is the case in other countries. Meanwhile, Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo said they had already informed Sinovac about what happened. “Yung Sinovac we also already informed them that we have 1 report of death of a patient who received the vaccine and later on developed COVID-19. We are asking them for information if there are similar cases that happened in other countries,” he said, adding that he does not consider the case unusual. While there are still no vaccines proven to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, Domingo reminded the public that it takes time for antibodies to develop after being vaccinated. “Ang lagi nating paalala, pag kayo ay nabakunahan hindi po iyon magic na biglang hindi na po kayo magkaroon ng COVID (We always remind people that after you are vaccinate it’s not like magic that you will no longer have COVID). It takes time. You have to give your body time to develop immunity and resistance against the COVID-19 virus after a vaccine is injected into your body,” he said. Lobo said this is why even for those vaccinated with 2 doses, they should still continue to follow physical distancing measures and other health protocols like wearing of face masks. “Remember the vaccines are not 100% protective,” he said. “There is a certain percentage it may not protect you. But at least it will give you a certain protection from severe COVID or moderate COVID. Do not let your guard down.” Data presented by the FDA showed that out of the 167,798 people vaccinated with Sinovac’s CoronaVac as of March 17 6p.m., 3,700 or 2.21% have so far experienced adverse events or side effects. Only 83 of those are considered serious and there is one case of death, referring to the 47-year-old female health worker. For AstraZeneca, of the 72,499 vaccinated, 3,715 or 5.19% adverse events following immunization were reported. So far, 54 of those were considered serious. Suspected adverse reactions for the two vaccines was at 3.11%. Domingo said this is within the accepted percentage since in clinical trials where AEFI monitoring is more pro-active, 20% to 30% report side effects such as mild pain in the injection site.'},\n",

Police arrested Rosanilla “Lai” Consad on Wednesday evening in Butuan City for an attempted homicide case in Agusan del Norte. She was also identified by authorities as a member of a “communist terrorist group.” In a statement, the teachers’ group noted that the arrest of Consad, a public school vice principal who also serves as ACT union secretary in Caraga, came following the issuance of a memorandum from the Department of the Interior and Local Government that identified ACT as a front organization for communist rebels. “Teacher Lai’s case only proves further that terrorist-tagging serves as a prelude to worse, more fascist attacks on rights, freedoms, and lives,” ACT said. “We demand that trumped up charges against Teacher Lai be dropped at once and she be immediately released from incarceration. We demand that all state forces who partook in the incessant attacks and harassment against her be investigated and held liable,” it added. ACT also called on the Department of Education to defend its teachers. The group also said Consad has been a target of “red-tagging” propaganda in Caraga since 2018 and took part in exposing alleged police profiling of ACT members the following year. “She has reported being tailed on her travels to and from school and surveilled even at her home,” ACT said. Local police, however, maintained that Consad was arrested for attacking and shooting a CAFGU member, and not because she was a member of a sectoral group. Also on Thursday, several lawmakers called on the House of Representatives to investigate the profiling of lawyers who represent “red-tagged” activists. In calling for the investigation, Albay 1st District Rep.

Again, one of the potential impacts of this variant is it increases transmissibility, meaning much like what we\\'re seeing in countries like the UK,\" she said. The health official called on the public to be vigilant. \"Our attitude should be enhanced [and] should always be on the lookout because we don\\'t want to become infected. We don\\'t want this to become the predominant variants in the Philippines,\" De Guzman said. \"If these variants of concern right now, it\\'s accounting for around 7 percent of all the samples we are sequencing. But what if it becomes 50 percent or what if it becomes all of the samples we\\'re sequencing [were] positive for these variants of concern, it really will lead to a large spike in our cases,\" she added. To date, the UK variant or B.1.1.7 has 41 local cases in the Cordillera Administrative Region, 39 in the National Capital Region, 4 in Calabarzon, 2 in Central Luzon and 1 in Northern Mindanao. Local cases refer to patients who have not traveled outside of the country. For the South African variant or B.1.351, there are 64 cases in NCR, and 1 each in Cagayan Valley and Northern Mindanao. Meanwhile, the first case of the Brazil variant or P.1 was found in a Filipino who had returned from the Latin American country.'},\n",

Government aims to immunize 50 to 70 million against the coronavirus this year to achieve herd immunity. Vaccinations will happen in stadiums and mega quarantine facilities, said Secretary Carlito Galvez. Philippines will try to vaccinate 1 million citizens per week in April, 2 million citizens per week in May, and 3 to 5 million per week beginning June, said Galvez. The country has so far inoculated 269,583 healthcare workers in 4,500 vaccination sites nationwide, Galvez said. \"Ang aming declaration is we\\'ll have a better Christmas this coming year. \\'Yun ang target namin na we will have a better Christmas.

The country\\'s COVID-19 supply currently relies on global alliance COVAX Facility, Sinovac, and AstraZeneca, Galvez said. It has so far paid 15 percent of P700 million jabs it ordered from the Chinese drugmaker, he added. It eyes an early shipment of 200,000 to 500,000 COVID-19 vaccines from Novavax by second quarter when the US Food and Drug Administration grants it emergency approval, followed by local regulators. The Philippines will also order 5 to 10 million doses of Russia\\'s Sputnik V when the FDA approves the drug\\'s emergency use, Galvez said. \"Initially magkakaroon kami ng 2 million this coming April,\" he said. (Initially, we\\'ll get 2 million this coming April.)

       "  'content': 'MANILA - Lawmakers have called on the House of Representatives to investigate the profiling of lawyers who represent red-tagged activists. \"This profiling of lawyers is a violation of the lawyer\\'s oath wherein a lawyer, among others, is sworn to uphold the Constitution and not to delay any client for money or malice,\" Albay 1st District Rep. Edcel Lagman told ANC. Lagman, Quezon City 6th District Rep. Kit Belmonte and Makabayan lawmakers on Tuesday filed House Resolution 1657 urging the lower house of Congress to condemn and investigate police\\'s profiling of lawyers defending red-tagged individuals. This stemmed over a letter from Calbayog police requesting for a list of lawyers representing “communist terrorist groups” or CTGs. In a letter dated March 12, 2021, Police Lt. Fernando Calabria, Jr., the intelligence chief of the Calbayog Police Station, asked the Office of the Clerk of Court in Calbayog Regional Trial Court for a list of lawyers who represent “CTG personalities in court.” No reason was cited for the request but the letter drew widespread condemnation because attached to it was a table with a heading in one column captioned “mode of neutralization.” Police have used the term “neutralization” in police reports on drug cases to refer to killings, as pointed out by the June 2020 report of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Philippine National Police has relieved Calabria from his post and has apologized to the legal community. Lagman noted that the action was sanctioned by higher PNP offices as indicated in Calabria\\'s letter to Calbayog RTC. \"Let me underscore that not only lawyers are being profiled [but also] people in government associated with cause-oriented groups like COURAGE and ACT Teachers for their membership in said organizations,\" he said. Lagman added, \"The problem is these repressive acts, red-tagging, weaponizing of search warrants, police raids, killing of non-combatant activists, they are all done because police and military elements are emboldened by the implementation of the Anti-Terrorism Law of 2020.\" Lagman is among petitioners challenging the validity of the law, which grants state forces sweeping powers to address terrorism. According to a study by the Free Legal Assistance Group, more lawyers were killed during the administration so far of President Rodrigo Duterte than under previous presidents since dictator Ferdinand Marcos combined. Nearly half of the killings or 26 were work-related, 15 were drug-related, 12 were allegedly due to personal motives, and the remaining 15 are unknown, the report showed.'},\n",

Sa taurpalin, pinasasalamatan siya dahil sa mabilis umanong paglaya ng kanila umanong kasamahan na sina Salem at Esparago. Kasama sa tarpaulin ang mga logo ng Communist Party of the Philippines, New Peoples’ Army at National Democratic Front. Agad kinondena ni Bayan Muna Rep. Ferdinand Gaite ang aniya’y pag-atake sa mga korte at pangha-harass sa mga huwes. \"The courts are under attack! After PNP\\'s attempt to profile HR (human rights) lawyers, now we\\'re seeing harassment vs. judges who expose their flawed searches!\" sabi ni Gaite. Puna ni Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate, marami raw talagang budget ang mga red tagger, sabay pagkondena sa tarpaulin na inilalagay umano sa kapahamakan ang seguridad ng hukom. Kabi-kabila rin ang mga batikos mula mga grupong Bayan Muna, Kapatid, Public Interest Law Center at maging sa Commission on Human Rights. \"We stress that members of the legal profession, such as lawyers and judges, are crucial in preserving constitutional rights, such as the right to an independent counsel; right to defend oneself in court; and right to speedy, public, and impartial trial among others,\" ani CHR spokesperson Jacqueline de Guia. Hiling ni Bayan Muna party-list chairman Neri Colmenares sa Korte Suprema, siguruhing maproteksyunan ang mga huwes gaya ni Quisumbing-Ignacio. \"We urge the Chief Justice to assure these judges, including Bacolod judge Ana Celeste Bernad who, like judge Ignacio, also voided judge Villavert’s warrants, of the Supreme Court’s protection in the performance of their function,\" ani Colmenares. Sumulat din sa SC ang mga propesor mula sa University of the Philippines College of Law para hilinging bumuo ng special committee to protect lawyers ang korte, kasunod ng paglabas ng sulat mula sa PNP na humihingi mula sa isang korte sa Calbayog ng listahan ng mga abogadong kumakatawan sa mga umano’y \"communist-terrorist groups.\" Para sa mga propesor, malinaw itong pananakot sa mga aogado na maaaring mauwi sa pagkakait sa mga inaakusahang \"komunista at terorista\" sa kanilang karapatang maipagtanggol ng mga abogado. Pero nangako si PNP OIC Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar na handa ang kapulisan na magbigay ng tulong sa mga abogado, fiscal at huwes na nasa panganib dala ng kanilang tungkulin. Sa tala ng National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers, 54 na abogado na ang napapatay sa ilalim ng administrasyong Duterte habang 61 naman ang bilang ng Free Legal Assistance Group, higit pa sa pinagsamang bilang ng mga napatay na abogado sa nakalipas na 6 na presidente. Sa isang joint statement, sinabi ng Philippine National Police at Integrated Bar of the Philippines na iimbestigahan ang lahat ng mga pagpatay sa mga abogado at lilitisin ang mga sangkot dito. Ang tumitinding red tagging sa mga aktibista, abogado at ilang personalidad sa oposisyon ang isa sa nakikitang nakakaalarmang mga pangyayari sa bansa sa nakalipas na mga buwan, base sa pag-aaral ng grupong Investigate PH na binubuo ng mga abogado at faith-based groups mula sa iba’t ibang bansa. Habang nagpapatuloy ang mga pagpatay sa ilalim ng war on drugs, lalo umanong nagkaroon ng mga human rights violations sa pagpasa ng Anti-Terrorism Act at pagbuo ng grupong national task force to end local communist armed conflict o ntf-elcac na aktibo umano sa pangrered-tag sa iba’t ibang grupo. \"Most individuals don\\'t even know they are violating Anti-Terrorism Act because of vagueness of it... We really see this being an instrument to silence political opponents. Silence those trying to do their jobs, journalists, human rights defenders,\" ani Suzanne Adely, high level commissioner ng grupo. Dagdag pa rito ang kawalan umano ng gumaganang paraan para makamit ang hustisya sa mga pang-aabuso. Isusumite ng grupo ang kanilang report sa UN Human Rights Council at International Criminal Court. Wala pa tugon ang panig ng National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict sa isyu. RELATED VIDEO'},\n",

       "  'content': 'MANILA - The Philippine government is eyeing the use of Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine on Filipino senior citizens when their vaccination begins around middle of next month, the country’s vaccine czar said Wednesday. That’s despite a previous recommendation from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration to use Sinovac shots only on healthy individuals between ages 18 to 59 years old. “Kasi nakita natin ‘yung Sinovac, very limited po ‘yung side effect,” National COVID-19 Task Force chief implementer Sec. Carlito Galvez Jr. said. “At the same time, walang gaanong wastage ‘yung Sinovac.\" Around 4 million senior citizens are currently in the government’s masterlist for inoculation, but Galvez said the number could eventually reach 9 million. PH EYES LOCAL COVID VACCINE PRODUCTION The Philippines is also looking into the possibility of producing COVID-19 vaccines locally. The government is in talks with the Serum Institute of India. “Gusto nila tulungan tayo na makapag-produce ng sarili nating bakuna,” Galvez said. “Ang mga hakbang na ito ay bahagi ng istratehiya ng pamahalaan na magkaroon ng stable and reliable source ng anti-COVID vaccines. Iyong stratehiya po na gagawin natin with SII, disease elimination by 2022,\" he said. The Research Institute of Tropical Medicine has reportedly submitted a three-year program to expand its vaccine research and development. CONNECTIVITY ISSUES The government’s launch of its COVID-19 vaccine tracker, meanwhile, will be delayed because of connectivity issues encountered by some hospitals, according to Galvez. “‘Yung ibang mga hospital wala pong internet. Iyon po ang nagkakaroon ng delay,” he said. “Medyo mahina ang internet connnection sa ibang lugar.\" “Pinag-uusapan ng private sector at Department of Information and Communications Technology na magkaroon ng integrated vaccine tracker” Galvez noted. Two senators previously urged the Duterte administration to release a COVID-19 tracker, saying it is important to monitor the progress of the country’s COVID vaccination program, especially since the country will loan billions of pesos for it.

       "  'content': \"MANILA - An official from the Department of Agriculture (DA) on Wednesday said an investigating panel has been created to look into an alleged kickback scheme in the agency linked to the proposed increase of pork imports even as he believes it does not exist. “Kami po ay naniniwala na wala naman pong ganyang ‘tongpats’ system sa Department of Agriculture, lalong-lalo na dito sa under ng leadership ni Sec. William Dar,” DA Undersecretary William Medrano told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo. (We believe that the alleged tongpats system does not exist in the DA, especially under Sec. William Dar's leadership.) Medrano said Dar created a fact-finding committee to find out whether the racket exists or not, noting that it was their first time hearing about the alleged scheme. In a statement, the DA said its legal service chief is heading the committee, which will base its inquiry on the initial findings of the DA-Minimum Access Volume (MAV) Secretariat. “While we stand firm that the issuance of MAV in-quota allocation is above-board and non-discretionary, we have created a special committee to look into allegations made by a lawmaker that there is a syndicate in the DA engaged in a payoff scheme,” Dar said in the statement. “Nasabi din ni Sen. (Panfilo) Lacson na matagal na raw ito. Kami po ay bago lamang sa DA, at first time namin narinig na mayroong ganyang ‘tongpats.’ Kami po ay naniniwala na sa ngayon ay wala pong ganyan,” Medrano said in the TeleRadyo interview. (Sen. Lacson mentioned that this already happened even before. We are just new to the DA, and it is our first time hearing about this tongpats. We believe that now, there is no such thing.) “Mayroong ongoing fact-finding at malalaman namin kung talagang mayroong tongpats system at kung sino ang mga tao,” he added. (There is an ongoing fact-finding committee and we will know whether it exists and who are the people behind it.) Lacson earlier this week alleged that a syndicate in the agriculture department would collect P5 to P7 for every kilo of the 400,000 metric tons of pork that will be imported in the proposal to increase the minimum access volume (MAV). This is equivalent to P6 billion in kickbacks, he said. RELATED VIDEO: Medrano pointed out that Lacson’s accusations remain as “anticipations” because the government has yet to approve the MAV increase, which would lower tariffs on pork imports. “Nag-anticipate siya [na] mangyari yung ganoon kalaki kapag matutuloy ‘yung approval at saka implementation noong increase ng MAV allocation... Sa ngayon, sa totoo lang, wala pang na-approve, wala pang implementation. Therefore, di naman nangyayari pa ‘yung sinasabing P6 billion na tongpats,” he said. (He is just anticipating that the people supposedly involved will get that money, should the MAV be approved. For now, there is no approval yet, no implementation. Therefore, no one has benefited yet from the supposed P6 billion.) Malacañang had said President Rodrigo Duterte would look into the matter, and that he still trusts Dar. A month ago, Dar said his agency already submitted to Malacañang its recommendation to increase the MAV on pork imports to raise the country's stock following supply woes caused by the African swine fever outbreak in the country. “We would like to emphasize that our objective in increasing the MAV and reducing tariff is to stabilize supply and price of pork,” the DA chief said Wednesday.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'MANILA (UPDATED) — The transmission of COVID-19 in Metro Manila, home to about a tenth of the Philippine population, has recently reached its highest level since May last year, the OCTA Research Group said on Wednesday, describing the situation as a \"serious surge\" in infections. The group, composed of university professors, noted that the capital region, which around a year ago was the first to be placed on community quarantine to stem the spread of the coronavirus, posted a 78 percent increase in new cases on Tuesday compared to a week ago. “The reproduction number in NCR increased to Rt = 1.96, its highest level since May 2020,” the OCTA Group said in its latest report. A reproduction number or R naught of more than 1 means that the infection is spreading to more people since one infected person can pass the virus to one or more individuals. A reproduction number of 2 means 2 people can be infected by one COVID-19 patient. Officials and analysts have attributed the recent spike in new cases to the increased mobility of people, non-compliance with health protocols, and the presence of more transmissible COVID-19 variants. Besides being classified as high risk based on its daily attack rate of 15.9 per 100,000 of the population, Metro Manila has reached 64 percent occupancy in terms of COVID-dedicated ICU beds, the research group said. Among local government units, Pasay, Makati, Navotas and Santiago City in Isabela had “very high” attack rates, which measure the proportion of the population infected with the COVID-19 virus. According to the OCTA Group, Santiago City had 1 reported case for the week of March 3-9, which increased to 244 for the week of March 10-16. Cases are also rising in Bacoor, Imus and Dasmariñas in Cavite, and in Antipolo City and Cainta in Rizal, all just outside Metro Manila, it said. Among local government units, the OCTA Group said Pasay, Makati, Navotas and Santiago, Isabela had “very high” attack rates. The attack rate if the proportion of the population infected by COVID-19. @ABSCBNNews pic.twitter.com/8Xu1zkSY6r  POSSIBLE DECLINE? The OCTA Group said that while Caloocan, Marikina and Mandaluyong had “very rapid increases” in cases, “Pasay, Malabon and Navotas experienced a slowing down as shown by lower percent increases in new COVID-19 cases compared to the previous week.” “This could be a good sign moving forward,” it said. Cebu City also had a “nearly flat” trend while new cases decreased by an average of 18% in Mandaue and Lapu Lapu cities, all in Region 7. With these observations and the ongoing measures being implemented by LGUs, the OCTA Group said its earlier projections of new cases, particularly in Metro Manila, may go lower. As early as March 1, the group already flagged the rising number of fresh infections in some parts of Metro Manila and warned that the country\\'s total cases may reach 665,000 by the end of the month if the trend continues. “As the NCR deals with a COVID-19 surge, we need to assess the effects of efforts by the local governments in dealing with the surge in their respective cities. The localized lockdowns in Pasay and Navotas have helped reduce the reproduction number (or infection rate of the virus) from Rt = 2.4 to 1.8,” the group said in its report on Wednesday. While the rate is still above 1, it shows that localized lockdowns “work to some extent”, it added. “Together with reduced mobility, curfews, stricter implementation of health protocols and city ordinances, this can help reduce the reproduction number in NCR to more manageable levels.” From a projection of 7,500 daily cases by the end of the month if the current trend continues, the OCTA group said Metro Manila may see less than 4,000 cases if the “more optimistic scenario” of having effective localized measures will prevail. It also projects only 6,000 cases daily instead of 16,000 by mid-April, if the interventions are sustained in the region that accounts for a third of the country\\'s economy. \"We simulated the combined effects of localized lockdowns, curfews and stricter implementation of health protocols. This projection paints a more optimistic scenario,\" the group said. It said the “combined efforts of the local governments and the citizens will further reduce the transmission rate and lower the reproduction number in NCR. If this happens, we will hopefully see fewer COVID-19 daily cases in the NCR.\" On top of localized lockdowns, which it said should be “humane and protective of individual rights,” expanded testing, contact tracing and “supported isolation” should also be done, the group said. The total number of COVID-19 cases in the country reached 635,698 on Wednesday after 6 days of more than 4,000 new cases. The Department of Health admitted that the current level of new cases is already at the same peak level as July last year. The country launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive on March 1, prioritizing health workers. It aims to inoculate up to 70 million to achieve herd immunity against the coronavirus. The Philippines\\' first COVID-19 case was confirmed on Jan. 30 last year in a Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan City, China where the disease is believed to have first emerged.

       "  'content': 'MAYNILA — Nagsumite na ng salaysay ang babaeng asset ng pulisya na natuklasang preso pala ng Quezon City Police District (QCPD) na ginamit para sa operasyon na kalaunan ay nauwi sa engkuwentro nila kontra Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). Sa dokumento na ipinasa sa National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) ay inilagay ang palitan ng text message nina Jonaire Decena, ang police asset, at umano\\'y drug dealer na si James Tan bago natuloy ang operasyon sa Commonwealth noong Pebrero 24. Sabi ng abogado ng QCPD, patunay raw ito na lehitimo ang kanilang operasyon noon, na nauwi sa madugong engkuwentro sa PDEA agents. \"Base sa evidence na hawak namin makikita kung sino ang may hawak ng pera. May show money kami para sa entrapment,\" paliwanag ni Noharddin Haron, abogado. Aminado ang QCPD na isang preso si Decena na inaresto noong Enero sa pagbebenta ng droga. Iniimbestigahan ng NBI kung bakit nakalabas ng kulungan si Decena nang walang pahintulot ng korte. Pero may paliwanag ang mga pulis. \"Considering the restrictions of the pandemic ngayon napakahirap kumuha ng court order . . . Justified yan under Article 11 [ng Revised Penal Code] na puwede kang gumawa ng harm kung ang pakay mo doon ay iwasan ang mas malaking harm,\" ani Haron. Tinanggi rin ng QCPD ang espekulasyon na \"palit ulo\" sana ang gagawin sa naturang preso. \"Palit ulo\" ang gawain umano ng ilang operatiba kung saan gagamitin ang mga nahuling suspek para magturo o tumulong sa pag-aresto ng ibang suspek, kapalit ay ang kanilang kalayaan. Lumalabas sa mga text message ni Decena na hindi nagpakita sa Commonwealth ang dealer na si Tan pero ang dumating umano ay ang tao niyang si alyas Bato na isa namang asset ng PDEA. Tumanggi namang magbigay ng pahayag ang PDEA tungkol sa imbestigasyon. —Ulat ni Niko Baua, ABS-CBN News'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Seniors posibleng turukan ng Sinovac: Galvez MAYNILA - Inaasahang mababakunahan ang nasa 1.7 milyong health workers pagdating ng Abril, ayon kay coronavirus disease (COVID-19) National Task Force chair Carlito Galvez Jr. Sa ngayon, nasa higit 240,000 o 14 porsiyento ng 1.7 milyong health worker pa lang ang nababakunahan kontra COVID-19 sa Pilipinas. Kaya naman sa pagtataya ni Galvez, na tumatayong vaccine czar, aabutin ng Abril ang pagbibigay ng unang dose ng bakuna sa lahat ng health workers. Unang nabanggit ni Galvez na ngayong Marso matatapos ang pagbabakuna sa health workers. \"Talagang medyo binabagalan natin ng kaunti dahil ‘yung napag-usapan po natin na mayroon adverse effects. Sa ngayon mayroon tayong accommodated na more or less 5,000 adverse effects, pero mga normal lang po, mga lagnat, parang lalagnatin,\" ani Galvez. Nasa 1,125,600 COVID-19 vaccine doses lang din ang kasalukuyang nasa bansa at nadala na sa implementing sites. Pero may mga pribadong ospital pa na hindi nakakatanggap ng alokasyon, ayon sa grupong Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines. \"Parang miscommunication with the DOH and these hospitals. Supposedly the hospitals were to submit requirements. Noong nag-inquire kami sa region, sabi dito n’yo dapat ipinapadala, hindi sa national office. So we have to again resend,” ani PHAPI President Dr. Jose Rene De Grano. Sa kasaluyang suplay ng bakuna sa bansa, higit 500,000 health workers lang ang mababakunahan. Pawang mga bakuna ng Sinovac at Astrazeneca sa ngayon ang itinuturok sa mga health workers. Inirekomenda na rin nina Galvez at Health Secretary Francisco Duque III kay Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte na gamitin na ang lahat ng paunang AstraZeneca vaccine doses na nasa bansa. \"\\'Yun ang recommendation ng WHO para magkaroon po ng larger population ng health workers na puwede maprotektahan. Kasi they assured us that there will be another tranche of AstraZeneca coming this April. May pa ang second dose nila,” ani Galvez. Nakatakdang dumating ngayong Marso ang 1.4 milyong dose ng Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine, kung saan 1 milyon ang binili ng gobyerno at 400,000 naman ay donasyon ng bansang China. Inaasahan naman na sa Abril darating ang mahigit-kumulang na 1 milyong doses ng AstraZeneca vaccines. Posible ring dumating ang 4 milyon pang doses ng bakuna, kung saan kalahati ay bibilhin sa Sinovac, at o-orderin sa Gamaleya ang Sputnik V oras na magkaroon ito ng emergency use authorization (EUA). Sa Mayo, 8 milyong doses ng bakuna ang inaasahan, kasama ang 2.6 milyon mula AstraZeneca, at 200,000 mula Moderna. Kung dumating sa oras ang mga bakunang ito, kakayanin umanong magbakuna ng 1 milyong Pinoy kada linggo pagdating ng Abril, na inaasahang madodoble pagdating ng Mayo, at aabot naman ng 3 hanggang 5 milyon kada linggo pagdating ng Hunyo. Inaasahan na kalagitnaan ng Abril magsisimula ang pagbabakuna ng mga senior citizen, mahihirap, at vulnerable sector. Nasa 4 milyon pa lang na senior citizen ang nasa master list ng gobyerno pero inaasahang aakyat pa ito sa 9 milyon. Ayon kay Galvez, bakuna ng Sinovac ang posibleng ibigay sa kanila, kahit inirekomenda lang ito ng Food and Drug Administration sa mga malulusog na taong edad 18 hanggang 59 anyos. Nakipag-usap na rin ang Pilipinas sa Serum Institute of India para pag-aralan ang pagbabalik ng kakayahan ng Pilipinas na makapag-produce ng bakuna. “Gusto nila tulungan tayo na makapag-produce ng sarili nating bakuna. Ang mga hakbang na ito ay bahagi ng istratehya ng pamahalaan na magkaroon ng stable and reliable source ng anti-COVID vaccines,” ani Galvez. — Ulat ni Vivienne Gulla, ABS-CBN News'},\n",

       "  'content': 'MANILA — The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday confirmed that its inspectors would no longer visit Russia to check on the manufacturing facility of Gamaleya Institute’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine. “The inspection trip to Russia did not push through because last Friday the applicant submitted the required documents and those are being reviewed,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said in a text message to ABS-CBN News. Domingo said this after another FDA official on Saturday said that the Russian-funded Gamaleya Institute had submitted all of its documents required for its emergency use authorization (EUA) application. COVID-19 vaccines under development are required to secure an EUA before they can be used for a country’s immunization program. On Saturday, the FDA official had said they would still evaluate if the inspection is needed. Domingo previously explained that every company applying for an EUA is required to submit a Certificate of Good Manufacturing Practice. Domingo did not say when they would finish the evaluation. Currently, only Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Sinovac have EUAs in the Philippines. Besides Gamaleya, also awaiting an EUA is India’s Bharat Biotech. Chinese government-owned Sinopharm also applied but has not submitted enough documents. As of Tuesday, more than 240,000 health workers have been vaccinated against COVID-19 using AstraZeneca and Sinovac doses. This is out of the more than 1.1 million doses that the country has received so far. The Philippines previously said it plans to buy 20 million doses of Sputnik V vaccines from Russia.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"MANILA - The occupancy rate in at least 20 private hospitals in Metro Manila has already reached critical levels amid the spike in COVID-19 cases, the Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines Inc. (PHAPI) said on Wednesday. In a virtual forum, PHAPI President Dr. Jose De Grano that a hospital with a critical occupancy rate means that it has already reached more than 85 percent of its capacity. Occupancy in 23 other health facilities is at high-risk level, or those which have 70 percent to 85 percent capacity, according to De Grano. RELATED STORIES: He also saw hospital occupancy increasing in Cebu City and the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). “Around 40 percent lang ang occupancy all over the country. However, there are areas like the National Capital Region, probably Region 7 [in] Cebu, and I found out recently, ‘yung CAR na mataas din ang kanilang occupancy rate,” he said. (CAR has a high occupancy rate.) He noted that the One Hospital Command could help refer patients to other facilities. Launched in August last year, the command is a centralized hospital occupancy monitoring system that aims to smoothen referrals of COVID-19 patients. RELATED VIDEO: DOWNSIZING De Grano noted that some private hospitals previously had to “downsize,” supposedly due to delays in PhilHealth reimbursements. He estimated that PHAPI members’ unpaid PhilHealth claims amount to at least P6 billion. Downsizing, he said, is a “huge problem” that said hospitals had to face in the middle of the health emergency. The state insurer earlier suspended the interim reimbursement mechanism program to review its overall implementation following the call of some lawmakers over allegedly irregular fund allocations to some hospitals amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “Around P6 billion, that was in December. Continuous po ‘yan, dahil hindi naman tumitigil ang pasok ng pasyente,” he said. (That's continuous because patients continue coming in.) He said an audit committee has been formed in hospitals to ensure documents are in order. De Grano also pointed out that some private hospitals are hoping to seek help from Congress to claim their reimbursements from PhilHealth, noting their limited manpower. “Kahit sabihin ng DOH (Department of Health) na you are authorized to make use of 20 percent of bed capacity as COVID beds. Kung ang aming nurses can only manage 10 beds, paano po ‘yun?” (Even if the DOH says we are authorized to make use of the 20 percent bed capacity as designated COVID-19 beds, our nurses can only manage up to 10 beds. How will we do this?) As the Lenten holidays near, PHAPI advises the public to stay at home and observe minimum health protocols. The Philippines on Wednesday reported 4,387 additional COVID-19 cases. For the first time ever, the daily tally topped 4,000 for 6 straight days. The day's new cases pushed the country's cumulative tally to 635,698.\"},\n",

       "  'content': 'Video courtesy of Department of Health MANILA — The Department of Health on Wednesday warned that if the Philippines is unable to control the spread of COVID-19 variants, the country may experience a 28-fold increase in new cases. “Ayaw nating umabot sa punto na lahat na ng samples na nasi-sequence natin ay magiging variants of concern na. \\'Pag ganun po, itong nakikita nating pagtaas hindi lang 3x, 4x. Pwedeng up to 28 times yung increase na makita natin,\" Dr. Alethea de Guzman, OIC Director III of the DOH Epidemiology Bureau, said during a virtual briefing. (We don’t want it to reach the point that all of our samples are variants of concern. If that’s the case, the increase we will see won’t be 3x, 4x, but up to 28 times increase.) \"And that will truly overwhelm our health system,” she added. A variant is considered a variant of concern if through assessment, it is demonstrated to be “associated with increased transmissibility or detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology,” among other things, according to the World Health Organization. Currently, there are 3 variants of concern in the Philippines: the B.1.1.7 first detected in the United Kingdom, the B.1.351 detected in South Africa, and the P.1 detected in Brazil. All are considered more transmissible, with the latter two said to contain an escape mutation that makes the virus better at evading a body’s immune response. The UK variant has 41 local cases in the Cordillera Administrative Region, 39 in the National Capital Region, 4 in Calabarzon, 2 in Central Luzon, and 1 in Northern Mindanao. Local cases refer to patients who have not traveled outside of the country. For the South African variant, there are 64 cases in NCR, and 1 each in Cagayan Valley and Northern Mindanao. Among the 17 NCR cities, 13 have the UK variant, while 8 have the South African variant. “Meron po tayong 74 or 27% ng lahat ng kaso ng variant of concern na returning overseas Filipino, at merong isang foreign national,” De Guzman said. (We have 74 cases or 24% of all those with variants of concern involving returning overseas Filipino, and there is a foreign national.) The health official said this is important to note because there is really a possibility for a new variant to enter the country. Because the Philippines does not have any plans to close its borders again, the DOH said it wants to minimize the risk as much as possible. “Napakahalaga yung patuloy na pagbabantay ng ating borders,” De Guzman said. (It’s important to continuously guard our borders.) De Guzman said only 6.6% of the COVID-positive samples sequenced by the Philippine Genome Center had variants of concern. “Napakahalaga na ngayong maliit na porsyento pa lamang ng ating sini-sequence ang nagpopositibo sa mga variants of concern. Ibig sabihin, we really have the opportunity now na matigil na \\'to, na \\'wag nang lalo pang lumaki ang dami at porsyento ng mga nagiging positibo para sa variants of concern,” she said. (It’s important that those positive cases sequenced with variants of concern are only a small percentage. This means, we really have the opportunity now that this can stop, and for those testing positive for the variants of concern to no longer increase.) A graph shared by De Guzman to media showed that cities with one variant of concern had higher incidence rates of COVID-19 than those without. Cities with two variants of concern had much higher incidence rates. But De Guzman said the graph also shows that cases are really increasing, even in areas without the variants of concern. “Oo, nakaka-contribute talaga itong mga variants of concern doon sa mabilis na pagtaas ng kaso natin because that’s the inherent characteristics of the variant,” she said. (Yes, the variants of concern really contribute to the quick rise in cases because that’s the inherent characteristics of the variant.) “Kahit wala tayong nakikita pang variant of concern sa maraming lugar sa Pilipinas, talagang merong pagtaas ng kaso dito sa iba’t ibang rehiyon, iba’t ibang probinsya, syudad at munisipyo natin. Ibig sabihin, hindi lang variants of concern ang dahilan ng pagtaas. Marami pang factors,” she added. (Even if we are not seeing variants of concern in many areas in the Philippines, there is still an increase in cases in different regions, provinces, cities and municipalities. This means that the variants of concern is not the only reason for the increase. There are many other factors.) De Guzman said the other reasons include the non-compliance with health protocols and the increased mobility of people. The health official said the increase in COVID cases being seen in the country is already comparable to the peak of infections in July. She cited data showing that more Filipinos are going out of their houses starting December. For the last 6 days, new COVID-19 cases in the country have been at least 4,000, bringing the total number of cases to 635,698 on Wednesday. Besides the 3 variants of concern, the WHO is also looking at the P.3 variant, which was first detected in the Philippines. It includes mutations that have been seen in other more transmissible variants but assessment is pending on whether it will be considered a variant of concern.'},\n",

Ayon sa infectious disease expert na si Dr. Rontgene Solante, dapat paalalahanan ulit ang publiko na hindi pa tapos ang pandemya. \"Dapat ibalik \\'yong compliance sa minimum health protocol. Okay lang [ang] increased mobility, pero dagdagan mo ingat mo,\" ani Solante. Ayon sa eksperto, hindi rin dapat balewalain ang oras kung kailan nagsimulang makaranas ng sintomas ng sakit, gaya ng lagnat, ubo, sipon at pananakit ng lalamunan. Una, dapat mag-isolate o humiwalay sa pamilya para hindi makahawa, at i-monitor ang sintomas. \"If there is one in the household transmitting the infection, mostly these are the symptomatics, because based on studies, if you\\'re asymptomatic, your risk of transmission is very low,\" paliwanag ni Solante. Sunod na gawin ay makipag-ugnayan agad sa barangay health workers. Maaari ring tumawag sa personal o family doctor. Kung hindi naman emergency case, magpakonsulta o humingi muna ng rekomendasyon sa pamamagitan ng tawag bago pumunta sa isang isolation facility o ospital. Iwasan ding mag-self-medicate at huwag balewalain ang sakit. \"All symptomatic, even the mild, should be evaluated thoroughly. So that\\'s the gap, the area that we are so negligent, na \\'Ah, kaunti lang \\'yong symptom na ito, okay na \\'ko nito,\\'\" ani Solante. Ayon kay Solante, hindi sapat na mag-isolate sa bahay dahil may posibilidad pa ring maipasa ang virus sa iba. Dapat din umanong magsuot ng face mask, mag-disinfect at ugaliing maghugas ng kamay. Isa ang San Juan sa mga lungsod na halos puno na ang isolation facilities pero hindi pa rin isinusulong ang home quarantine, lalo\\'t kung masikip ang bahay, at walang sariling kuwarto at banyo. \"Mayroon tayong kino-convert na additional school buildings, ating mga public schools, into quarantine facilities,\" ani San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora. \"That\\'s another challenge by our government, to put up more of these facilities because the hospitals cannot accommodate them... Itong mga mild symptoms, doon \\'yan sa mga quarantine facilities,\" ani Solante. Dapat din umanong sumunod sa rekomendasyon ng local government unit at doktor hinggil sa swab test at pag-quarantine. Bukod sa barangay, dapat ding ipagbigay-alam sa employer ang situwasyon ng pasyente. Kung dumeretso naman sa ospital ang pasyente, naitatawag rin anila ang mga kaso sa barangay para makapag-contact tracing. Para makaiwas sa sakit, muling pinaalala ni Solante na huwag nang lumabas ng bahay kung hindi naman kailangan. Para naman sa mga pumapasok sa trabaho, iminumungkahing huwag munang sumabay kumain sa mga kasama sa bahay, lalo kung may senior citizen o immunocompromised. Sakaling mangailangan ng tulong, maaaring tumawag sa mga COVID-19 hotline: Narito naman ang mga numero ng Department of Health emergency management bureau operations center: I-press ang 1, saka i-dial ang local na 2206 o 2207. -- Ulat ni Angel Movido, ABS-CBN News [BOLD] RELATED VIDEO:'},\n",

Linda, 49, said she feels like she is on call the entire day, attending to queries of students and parents even at ungodly hours, unlike before when it felt like teachers were relieved of their duties after work hours. “Ang hirap kasi hindi katulad dati, noon na face-to-face, na after mong magturo sa mga bata, tapos na ‘yong responsibility mo sa kanila… ‘Di katulad ngayon, parang 24 hours,” she said. (It’s difficult because it’s not like before, when there was face-to-face classes, after you teach the children, you’re finished with your responsibilities to them… unlike now, it feels like you’re at work for 24 hours.) Linda also said distance learning does not seem to be effective for children without adults to guide them in their studies at home, recounting how some of her first grade students still found it difficult to read. But Linda and her young pupils are not the only ones having difficulties with the new setup. Grade 12 student Marl Mora also said he experiences challenges that hinder him from fully absorbing his lessons. “Kaunti lang ‘yong natutunan…. Kapag magre-rely sa module lang, kaunti lang talaga ‘yong matututunan. Kapag puro search [sa internet] naman, mas madali siyang nakakalimutan,” he said. (I don’t learn a lot… If you rely on modules alone, you won’t really learn much. If you rely on internet searches, you easily forget what you are supposed to learn.) “Sa internet, minsan unstable and nawawala. Hindi makapag-connect sa class kaya minsan naiiwan,” he added. (Sometimes our internet is unstable and sometimes we lose connection. We can’t connect to the class so we are left behind.) Mora also helps earn money for his family by selling vegetables, which he said was stressful since he juggles it with his studies. “Mahirap kumita ng pera kaya dagdag-pagod. Namamalengke kami every other day ng madaling araw, mga 3 or 4 a.m. kaya halos laging puyat tapos sasabayan pa ng modules na maraming gawain kaya medyo masakit sa ulo,” he said. (It’s hard to earn money so it’s more exhausting. We go to the market every other day, around 3 or 4 a.m. so I don’t get enough sleep. Along with that, I have to answer modules so it’s a bit of a headache.) Because of these experiences, both Linda and Mora said that they are in favor of limited face-to-face classes. “Hindi pa rin kasi mapapalitan ang experience and ang knowledge na matutunan kapag face-to-face learning. Kahit na half day or half lang ng classes,” Mora said. (You can’t replace the experience and knowledge that you learn when there’s face-to-face classes. They should allow even half-day classes or half of the class to attend.) “At least ‘yong mga bata, magkaroon din ng communication sa teacher nila kasi lalo na ang primary grade, kailangan hands on ‘yong teacher sa bata,” said Linda. (At least the children could communicate with their teacher, especially those in the primary grade. Teachers need to be hands on with children.) Calls for the safe reopening of schools have been growing, a year since government prohibited in-person classes. It remains unknown, however, when face-to-face instruction would continue, especially since President Rodrigo Duterte remained reluctant to send students back to classrooms. Duterte earlier said he would only allow in-person classes once COVID-19 vaccines become available in the country. But during the arrival of the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines from China last Feb. 28, Duterte said he would still not allow physical classes. “I cannot make that decision. It will place the children in jeopardy… I am not ready to lose the lives of our young people,” Duterte said. Prior to this, Duterte gave the green light for a dry run of limited in-person classes, acknowledging that the distance learning set up was “far from ideal.” He later cancelled this due to the concerns with the more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant from the United Kingdom. Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles had said Duterte could reconsider authorizing the pilot test for face-to-face classes once the country has rolled out 2 million COVID-19 vaccines, even though United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) does not recommend vaccination as a “prerequisite” for the reopening of schools. Need for in-person classes The DepEd, which is pushing for the gradual resumption of in-person classes, saw the need for face-to-face instruction to address the challenges in distance learning, such as uneven access to technology and students’ difficulty in self-learning. A nationwide online survey conducted by the Movement for Safe, Equitable, Quality, and Relevant Education found that a majority of teachers “do not think or are not confident that the competencies set by the Department of Education under distance learning are actually being developed.” Several lawmakers and groups have also called for the safe reopening of schools. The Senate, last March 2, passed a resolution recommending the conduct of in-person classes where there are few to zero COVID-19 cases. The Philippines is the only country in the Asia-Pacific region that has yet to reopen schools, even on a limited scale to complement distance learning modalities. John Andrew Camposano of the Philippine Pediatric Society warned that “one year of school closure would be equivalent to 2 years of learning loss.” “In the long term, there is also an increased risk of disengagement or dropouts, there is a decrease in motivation to learn. Some children may not return to school,” Camposano said in a Senate hearing last Feb. 24. Philippine Business for Education Executive Director Love Basillote said prolonged school closure might lead to heavier losses for the country’s economy. Those who dropped out from school in 2020 may have difficulty landing jobs since companies would look for candidates with credentials and specific skill sets, she said. Over 26.6 million students registered in basic education for School Year 2020-2021, based on DepEd data last Jan. 15, down by around a million from the previous year. Education Secretary Leonor Briones had said the department was ready to hold the dry run of in-person classes “any time that the president says go.” Schools as a refuge for the abused Aside from learning, schools also serve as safe havens for children experiencing violence in their homes, said Behzad Noubary, deputy representative of UNICEF in the Philippines. “Schools beyond being a place of learning for children also serve as a place for socialization… As well as a refuge for children who may be experiencing physical or psychological violence outside of the school,” he said. Experts have also said the pandemic has put children’s social development at risk since they lost opportunities to bond with other kids. In higher education, Duterte has allowed in-person classes for select medical courses in areas with low quarantine restriction levels to ensure that the country had enough health frontliners during the pandemic. As of writing, the country has recorded 631,320 COVID-19 cases as it also faced a surge in infections. – With reports from Arra Perez, Jamaine Punzalan, and Sherrie Ann Torres, ABS-CBN News'},\n",

       "  'content': 'MAYNILA - Maraming katanungan pa rin ang nais na masagot ng publiko hinggil sa magiging epekto ng mga bakuna kontra COVID-19. Sa segment na “Bakuna Muna” sa programang Kabayan sa TeleRadyo nitong Miyerkoles, binigyang-linaw ni Dr. Lulu Bravo, chairperson ng National Adverse Effect Following Immunization Committee, ang ilang agam-agam ng publiko. POSIBLENG SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECT NG BAKUNA: “Ang isang serious effect ay anaphylactic shock at ito ay ang severe allergy na ngayon nakikita rin natin, pero sa naunang report sa atin ng CoronaVac at Astra ay hindi nakasaad sa kanilang report. Hindi lumabas sa report nila, pero ngayon nakikita natin dito sa ating monitoring system. Medyo kailangang imbestigahan pa kasi sa mga naunang mga report bago pa tayo nag-umpisang mag rollout, syempre pinag-aaralan yan ng ating mga eksperto, parang ‘di nakita masyado yung anaphylaxis kaya ngayon tinitingnan natin, iniimbestigahan natin kung talagang yang anaphylaxis na yan ay nakikita nang mas marami kaysa doon sa ibang mga bansa. Handang-handa na ang ating vaccinators sa tinatawag nating anaphylaxis kasi nakita nga nila meron talagang posibleng mangyaring ganyan so handa ang emergency kit ng bawat vaccination center.” MAAARI BANG MA-CONFINE SA OSPITAL ANG MAKARARANAS NG ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK? “Iba-iba, may iba mabilis lang mawala, meron talaga a few hours nasa emergency room, binabantayan sila, nawawala agad, nakaka-uwi agad. Meron namang medyo severe pati kaniyang blood pressure bumabagsak naman. Ang anaphylaxis karaniwang bagsak ang blood pressure. Pagka medyo bumabagsak ang blood pressure dapat bantayan kasi delikado yung bumabagsak ang blood pressure. We are really exercising the outmost care for our patients.” UPDATE SA ISYU NG BLOOD CLOTTING SA BAKUNANG ASTRAZENECA: “Naireport yan sa Norway, sa Austria, at temporarily may mga bansa sa Europa, and even sa Asia, itong Thailand, itinigil muna nila temporarily yung pagbabakuna. Tinanong namin ang WHO. Ang sabi ng WHO, yes, its under investigation in that country pero halos 17-M na ang nabigyan ng AstraZeneca at hindi naman nila nakita na mayroong ganung klaseng concern o red flag na hindi maganda, na yung thromboembolism ay talagang dumami sa 17 million na nabakuhan. Tingin nila, kailangan lang talaga i-compare mo doon sa mga countries na yun kung yung thromboembolism na yun mas marami doon sa mga nabakunahan kesa doon sa mga hindi pa nababakunahan.” MAY BAKUNA NA BA KONTRA COVID-19 PARA SA BATA? “Wala pa tayong bakuna ng COVID para sa 18 years old, pababa. Yung hindi pa nag-18 hindi pa dapat bakunahan, wala pang bakuna dyan.” MAY EXPIRATION BA ANG BAKUNA: “Merong expiration date yun, At ang alam ko yung sa AstraZeneca, parang May 2021. Yung sa Sinovac ay 2024 pa. Gagawa sila ng paraan na hindi mag-expire yan kasi sayang naman ang bakuna.” LIGTAS BA NA MAGPABAKUNA ANG SENIOR CITIZEN NA DIABETIC AT HYPERTENSIVE: “Sa ngayon, ang mga senior citizen na 60 and above ay ang Astra lang ang pwedeng ibigay. Yung sa Sinovac, unless you sign a waiver na wala ka namang ibang kondisyon like hypertension, diabetes hindi pa kasi yan nirerekomenda kasi kulang ang datos na itong Sinovac na naibigay sa mga maysakit na may hypertension at diabetes. Pero yung sa Astra, meron na tayong datos kaya yun ay narerekomenda sa senior citizens, at doon sa may hypertension din, diabetes, asthma—yung tinatawag nating comorbidities, may ibang sakit sila.” PAGBABAKUNA SA TAONG NAGPOSITIBONG SA COVID-19: “Hindi tayo nagte-test bago mabakunahan kung ikaw ay may COVID o wala, although sa screening tinatanong kung meron siyang naging sakit na COVID bago bakunahan. Kasi kung nagkasakit ka ng COVID, you will receive a vaccine only after 90 days. Dapat ganun, pero kung ikaw naman unintentionally, ‘di mo alam na meron ka na palang COVID tapos nabakunahan ka, ang tingin namin hindi masama yun kaya lang hindi porket nabakunahan ka ay hindi na magpo-progress yung COVID mo because there is a possibility na yung COVID mo na nag-iincubate, nag-uumpisa pa lang pero ‘di mo alam ay magtuloy-tuloy at posible kang magkaroon ng sakit in the following days. Pero yung bakuna mo, sa tingin namin, hindi makakasama pero hindi rin makakatulong na i-stop yun COVID mo.” Magugunitong nakatanggap ang Pilipinas ng 600,000 doses ng Sinovac mula China at 525,000 shots naman ng AstraZeneca mula sa COVAX Facility. Nitong Martes, umabot na sa 216,794 health workers ang nabakunahan na simula nang mag rollout ng bakuna.'},\n",

Nitong Miyerkoles, namili si Alim ng tela para sa negosyo. \"Medyo natatakot din po pero doble ingat na lang. Dito kasi mas mura eh,\" ani Alim. \"Kailangan patuloy pa rin kasi mahirap ang buhay,\" dagdag niya. Namili naman si Marianie Altabarino ng damit na ipapadala sa kaniyang pamangkin sa Negros. \"Day off ko rin sa trabaho ko kaya ngayon lang ako pumunta,\" sabi ni Altabarino, na hindi umano natatakot sa COVID-19. Kaniya-kaniyang pagsisikap ang ginagawa ng mga vendor para ipaalala sa mga mamimili na sumunod sa mga health protocol. Wala namang problema sa naka-face mask pero marami ang nahihirapang magsuot ng face shield. Mahirap ding ipatupad ang physical distancing, lalo sa mga masisikip na kalsada. \"Sinasabihan po namin sila, distancing po. Huwag po kayong magdikit-dikit,\" anang vendor na si Jimboy Arcilla. Pahirapan ang deployment ng mga awtoridad sa Divisoria dahil sunod-sunod na nagpositibo sa COVID-19 ang mga pulis sa Binondo station, na nakakasakop sa shopping area. Sa 121 na nagpa-swab test, 48 ang positibo habang may 38 pang naghihintay ng resulta. Naka-lockdown na umano ang istasyon.

       "  'content': \"MANILA (UPDATE) - More than a year into the COVID-19 lockdown, the Philippines on Wednesday reported 4,387 new COVID-19 cases, raising the country’s total number of infections to 635,698. This is the 6th straight day that newly-confirmed cases exceeded 4,000, data showed. But the day’s additional cases do not include results from six Department of Health (DOH)-accredited testing laboratories that failed to submit data on time. ABS-CBN Data Analytics Head Edson Guido said this is the first time that the trend happened since the pandemic hit the country. The ABS-CBN Investigative and Research Group noted that the day's number of new cases is the sixth highest so far this year. The health department earlier in the day admitted that new COVID-19 cases in the country had reached the same peak level in July last year, noting as well the rise of infections in households or offices. With 561,099 total recoveries and 12,866 total COVID-related fatalities, active infections stood at 61,733, or 9.7 percent of the cumulative total cases. Guido said the number of active cases in the country is the highest since Sept. 26 last year. Some 96.8 percent of the patients still battling the disease are experiencing mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, the latest bulletin showed. A total of 1.2 percent are critically ill, while 1.3 percent are severely ill. The DOH logged 374 additional recoveries, and 18 new deaths. It is the second straight day that additional fatalities counted fewer than 20. The Philippine Statistics Authority earlier said that almost 28,000 died in the country last year due to COVID-19, but the DOH clarified that probable and suspect cases were included in the statistics agency’s data. Out of 37,608 individuals who last underwent testing for COVID-19, 5,321 or 14.1 percent were found to be positive for the disease. A total of 9 duplicate cases have been removed from the list. Six of those were found to be recoveries. Five cases initially classified as recoveries, on the other hand, turned out to be deaths after the agency's final validation. The OCTA Research Group this week projected that if the current trend continues, new coronavirus cases in the Philippines can reach up to 11,000 daily. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III rejected placing Metro Manila under stricter lockdown even as the region continues to log most of the newly-reported infections. Globally, the COVID-19 already infected almost 121 million, of whom 2.7 million have died and 68.4 million have recovered, based on US-based Johns Hopkins University's running tally. The Philippines logged its first case on Jan. 30 last year in a Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan City, China where the disease is believed to have first emerged.\"},\n",

DOH said the health worker who died on March 13\\xa0\"tested positive for COVID 19.\" This is the first death after vaccination reported by the DOH. Last week, the DOH said the vaccine mostly registered minor side effects. The only serious adverse events recorded as of last week were difficulty of breathing and chest paints. Over 240,000 health workers in the Philippines have already been vaccinated against COVID-19 more than two weeks after the vaccines arrived in the country. Experts have repeatedly explained that while adverse events following vaccination may be observed, a large number of them may not be actually caused by the vaccination. This is why investigation is done by expert panels to prove the cause. The DOH explained that vaccines “are only one part of the solution in bringing the COVID-19 pandemic to an end.” “Even with vaccines, people must continue with the important prevention measures already in place: wearing masks, maintaining physical distancing, washing hands frequently, and avoiding crowded places and settings,” it said. Despite the reported death, the DOH and the Food and Drug Administration said health workers must still be vaccinated, especially with the surge in COVID-19 cases in the country. “Millions of people around the world have received this vaccine, and evidence continues to show that the benefit of vaccination outweighs the risk of severe disease and death caused by COVID-19,” the institutions said.

       "  'content': \"MANILA — The Department of Health on Wednesday explained that probable and suspect COVID-19 cases were included in the Philippine Statistics Authority's tally of more than 27,000 coronavirus deaths last year, over twice the department's current count. In its latest data released this week, the PSA said that COVID-19 ranks among the leading causes of death in the country. But of the 27,967 listed deaths under COVID-19, 19,758 were under “COVID-19 virus not identified” and 8,209 were under “COVID-19 virus identified.” Dr. Alethea de Guzman, OIC Director III of the DOH Epidemiology Bureau, told reporters that the DOH only counts confirmed cases, which have complete dates of death and validated causes of death. “Ang ating PSA kasama nilang inire-report 'yun pong mga death na ang nakalagay kahit suspect COVID lang 'yan or probable COVID lang ang nakasulat sa death certificate, isinasama nila sa counts 'yun na mga COVID-related deaths,” she said. (Our PSA includes in their reports even the deaths that are suspect COVID or probable COVID based on their death certificate.) Video courtesy of the Department of Health Based on DOH data, by the end of 2020, there were more than 9,000 COVID-related deaths. As of March 16, 2021, the total is at 12,848. De Guzman said when they last consolidated data with the PSA, the number of deaths increased but there are still some that cannot be confirmed due to the delayed reporting of information from local government units. The health official assured the public that they are also tracking the said deaths but that they are dependent on information shared by local reporting units. “At the end of the day, the strategy is the same. You have to consult early. You need to have access to a health care facility,” she advised the public. De Guzman said they also want to see if the deaths from other diseases also grew in number, partly because of the pandemic. But, she added, it’s hard to analyze it because the data might still be incomplete. “The number of deaths being reported in PSA it’s less in 2020 than reported in 2019. It’s most likely people are not being able to report,” she said, adding that the reports are very delayed. Based on latest data, heart disease is still the leading cause of death in the Philippines. The number of suicide cases also significantly increased. The DOH said it is also tracking the health care utilization rate of hospitals to ensure that those who need the most care can be accommodated. For the past weeks, the number of new COVID-19 cases has been increasing. De Guzman said the country already reached the same peak level in July last year.\"},\n",

Ito'y sa gitna ng muling pagsirit ng bilang ng mga kaso ng COVID-19, na ayon sa gobyerno ay bumalik na sa lebel noong kasagsagan ng pandemya noong Hulyo 2020. “Ako tingin ko hindi na. We must really double our efforts to make people understand 'yung health protocol, damihan pa natin ang testing at contact tracing, doon tayo,” sabi ni Abalos sa panayam sa TeleRadyo Miyerkoles ng umaga. Tanging granular lockdown ang pinaiiral ngayon sa mga lugar na maraming kaso ng COVID-19. Ito'y habang ang Metro Manila ay nananatili sa general community quarantine, ang ikalawang pinakamababang quarantine level. “Wala naman tayong lockdown ngayon po. What we have are granular. Ibig sabihin ng granular, bahay-bahay lang, kalye-kalye lang. The most, isang barangay. I don’t think we’ll have any lockdown at all. Hindi na mauulit siguro 'yun basta magkatulungan,” ani Abalos. Marami na aniyang mga taong nawalan ng trabaho at nagugutom kaya’t hindi makatutulong sa ekonomiya ang malawakang paghihigpit sa Metro Manila.

       "  'content': 'MANILA - Heart diseases remained the top cause of death among Filipinos in 2020, according to data from the Philippine Statistics Office (PSA) released on Tuesday. The number of people who died due to ischemic heart diseases rose to 99,700 cases (17.3 percent) compared to 97,500 cases (15.7 percent) in 2019, PSA added. Cancer was the second leading cause of death, with 62,300 (10.8 percent) cases recorded. Cerebrovascular diseases claimed 59,700 (10.4 percent) lives in 2020, while diabetes mellitus ranked fourth with 37,300 cases (6.5 percent). The top 3 causes of death in the Philippines remained the same in the last 5 years, PSA added. But the number of registered deaths due to ischemic heart diseases and diabetes mellitus exceeded their averages in the last five years of 82, 527 and 32,991, respectively deaths caused by pneumonia had the biggest decline, with 24,300 thousand less deaths in 2020 than its average in the past five years. Deaths due to pneumonia, which recorded 32,600 cases (5.7 percent) posted a 48.1 percent decrease from 62.7 thousand (10.1 percent) in 2019. It was still however the fifth leading cause of death for the year, it said. PREVENTING HEART DISEASES In its manual \"Dietary Guidelines for the Prevention of Heart Disease and Diabetes,\" the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI-DOST) recommended the following: - Prepare and eat foods that are low in fat and cholesterol. Fat should contribute about 20-25% of the total calories we eat. Fat from plant sources like peanuts, soybeans, cottonseed, corn, safflower, and from fish oil are better than animal fat.\\r\\n- Eat foods that are high in fiber. Fibers especially the soluble ones have cholesterol-lowering properties and are found in most fruits, vegetables, beans and grains.\\r\\n- Limit intake of salty foods. Sodium in salt causes hypertension when taken in excess. Convenience foods like tocino, longanisa, sausage, hotdog, ham, bacon and the like are rich in salt.\\r\\n- Always maintain an ideal weight. Overweight or obese persons are more prone to heart disease.\\r\\n- Exercise regularly. At least 15-30 minutes of physical exercise, 3-4 times weekly, can help reduce your risks for heart disease. It also lowers blood pressure and cholesterol.\\r\\n- Stop smoking. Cigarette smoking is the most important preventable cause of coronary heart disease that often leads to heart attack.\\r\\n- Drink alcohol in moderation. Drinking a lot will most likely develop high blood pressure and eventually heart disease.\\r\\n- Visit your doctor regularly. If you have one or two of the risks of developing heart disease, have regular check-up of your blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugar so that early treatment can be done. - With reports from Josiah Antonio, ABS-CBN News'},\n",

Wala aniya clinical trials at hindi rin aprubado ang naturang gamot para sa viral infection. Ang Ivermectin ay aprubado lang para sa hayop laban sa heartworm disease at internal and external parasites sa ilang mga hayop.

       "  'content': 'MANILA - A lawyer\\'s group on Wednesday called on the high tribunal to provide additional safeguards in the implementation of warrants aside from requiring law enforcers to wear body cameras. Lawyer Rey Cortez, secretary general of National Union of Peoples\\' Lawyers, welcomed that the Supreme Court magistrates were considering a proposal requiring law enforcers to wear body cameras to prevent abuses in the service of warrants. \"But of course, it\\'s a complex issue. Wearing of a body cam will only solve a part of the problem,\" he told ANC. \"What NUPL wants is the Supreme Court should include in its resolution safeguards, in addition to just simply wearing body cams.\" The human rights lawyer noted that law enforcers were \"very creative\" when they enforced warrants. Based on his experience, law enforcers would barge into a house, herd the occupants into a separate place and conduct the search. A second search is conducted with the presence of witnesses such as village officials where \"usually they find alleged firearms and explosives,\" Cortez said. \"If first they will not wear body cameras, hindi natin makikita \\'yong mga planting of evidence at sa mga irregularities doon sa pagpasok palang,\" he added. (... we will not see the planting of evidence and other irregularities even when they enter a place.) The lawyers\\' group also raised concern about the manner the warrants were issued. The Philippine Constitution and the Rules of Court require judges to personally determine if there is probable cause to issue arrest or search warrants after examining the complainant and witnesses under oath. \"Hindi ito isang subpoena (This is not a subpoena) that you can issue as a matter of fact, as a matter of procedure,\" he said. \"This is a process you issue that will authorize law enforces to intrude into the privacy of individuals, which is an exception to the constitutional right to privacy.\" Human rights and lawyers’ groups have long raised the issue of courts acting as “warrant factories” issuing multiple search warrants in a day or two. Cortez was reacting to a statement from the Supreme Court that the police applied for 72 search warrants for the raids on March 7 that eventually became a “Bloody Sunday” in Calabarzon. The police and military implemented 24 search warrants in Cavite, Batangas and Rizal that left 9 activists dead and 3 others arrested. Among those killed were Manny Asuncion, coordinator of activist group Bagong Alyansang Makabayan in Cavite, and fisherfolk leaders Chai Lemita-Evangelista and Ariel Evangelista in Batangas. Activists and rights groups have accused the Philippine government of “weaponizing” search warrants against alleged communist rebels.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'MANILA (UPDATE) — More than 150 professors from the UP College of Law and more than 700 lawyers wrote to the Supreme Court Tuesday to express concern over a letter from Calbayog police requesting for a list of lawyers representing “communist terrorist groups” (CTGs). The group of professors, led by newly-installed Dean Edgardo Carlo Vistan II, said they were \"deeply troubled and concerned by this brazen and outright attempt to curtail legal rights and civil liberties.\" “Several of our professional brethren have already been killed for no clear reason other than that they represented accused who were alleged to be members of communist groups or allied organizations,” the letter read. In a letter dated March 12, 2021, Police Lt. Fernando Calabria, Jr., the intelligence chief of the Calbayog Police Station, asked the Office of the Clerk of Court in Calbayog Regional Trial Court for a list of lawyers who represent “CTG personalities in court.” No reason was cited for the request but the letter drew widespread condemnation because attached to it was a table with a heading in one column captioned “mode of neutralization.” Police have used the term “neutralization” in police reports on drug cases to refer to killings, as pointed out by the June 2020 report of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. “This police action is clearly meant to (a) intimidate lawyers from representing persons that the government has tagged as alleged members of CTGs even without benefit of trial, (b) indirectly deprive persons accused as ‘CTG personalities’ of their right to counsel by frightening lawyers from being associated with them, even if they do so as officers of the court, and (c) provide the PNP with another ‘list’ of ‘personalities’ against whom they may decide to take other actions in the future,” the professors said. The PNP’s move is a “patent demonstration of impunity\" aside from being a blatant attempt to make courts complicit in possible violations of constitutional rights, the letter read. “It should not be left to stand. Never in the history of our country has there ever been such an open and flagrant attempt to cow the legal community into shirking their sworn duties as lawyers and officers of the court through an act of discrimination and inquisition clearly targeting lawyers for representing a particular category of accused clients,” it said. PNP OIC Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar has relieved Calabria from his post and has apologized to the legal community over Calabria’s “reckless behavior” but he denied there is an order from top PNP officials for such a letter request. But Calabria in his letter to Calbayog RTC cited “compliance from higher PNP offices.” Vistan also said in his letter to the SC that similar letters making the same request have been received by other judges. JUDGE RED-TAGGED On the same day that UP Law professors submitted their letter to the Supreme Court, the judge who junked the illegal possession of firearms and explosives cases against journalist Lady Ann Salem and unionist Rodrigo Esparago became the target of red-tagging herself. Bayan Muna Rep. Ferdinand Gaite shares photo taken at footbridge in EDSA-Shaw of a tarpaulin bearing face of Mandaluyong Judge Monique Quisumbing-Ignacio along with CPP-NPA logos. Gaite calls it an act of harassment after judge junked cases vs Lady Ann Salem, Rodrigo Esparago. pic.twitter.com/7Wr2CIpScH  A photo of Mandaluyong RTC Judge Monique Quisumbing-Ignacio was seen on 2 tarpaulins hung on footbridges along EDSA with the caption: “Maraming Salamat! Judge Monique Quisumbing-Ignacio RTC Br. 209, Mandaluyong City sa mabilis na paglaya ng kasama nating Lady Ann Salem at Rodrigo Esparago. Tuloy ang Laban!!! Mabuhay!!!” The message came with logos of the Communist Party of the Philippines, New Peoples’ Army and National Democratic Front. “The Courts are under attack! After PNP’s attempt to profile HR lawyers, now we’re seeing harassment vs. judges who expose their flawed searches!” Bayan Muna Rep. Ferdinand Gaite said in sharing the photo of the tarpaulin. “I condemn this act of intimidation against Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio. Hands off the Judiciary! Hands off Human Rights Lawyers!” he added. Quisumbing-Ignacio voided the search warrant issued by Quezon City Executive Judge Cecilyn Burgos-Villavert for being “vague.” Gaite referred to the incident as “tarpaulin terrorism.” Several tarpaulins have previously been hanged in different parts of Metro Manila condemning the CPP-NPA-NDF although no one has claimed responsibility for the tarps. “The tarps speak for themselves. Independent, fair minded judges are under attack. Who has the motive to produce such inanity other than those extremely fond of red-tagging. Their handiwork will boomerang on them,” the group KAPATID said in reaction to the tarpaulins. In a statement, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines urged all parties not to drag judges into their political or ideological issues or agenda. \"We enjoin all litigants, parties, and sectors not to unduly drag our magistrates into their political, ideological, or operational battles or agenda. Instead of terrorizing or attacking the judges, bring before them the best evidence and arguments so that they may discern the truth and act solely based on facts and the applicable laws,\" IBP National President Domingo Egon Cayosa said. \"As we advocate for JUSTICE BILIS, we pray that our judges will have the courage to do what the law requires them to do, though dangerous or unpopular and the integrity to remain unswayed by identity, race, gender, relationship, wealth, or politics,\" he added. WHAT CAN SC DO? While the UP Law Faculty letter did not mention the latest red-tagging incident involving Judge Quisumbing-Ignacio, it called on the Supreme Court to use its power to promulgate rules for the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights as well as its administrative supervision over all courts and personnel. “These powers may be exercised motu proprio — and in these urgent circumstances, must be so exercised — by requiring an official explanation from the PNP leadership, at the first instance, and commencing proceedings perhaps towards ensuring that such instances never, ever happen again.” In an accompanying letter, Dean Vistan asked SC to convene a “Special Committee to Protect Lawyers” to probe the Calbayog PNP letter and other attempts to profile and red-tag lawyers, verify the number of lawyers killed and study the need to amend the rules on writs of amparo and habeas data.

The National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers on Monday wrote to UN special rapporteur on independence of judges and lawyers Diego García-Sayán about the attacks on Filipino lawyers, particularly on NUPL member Angelo Karlo Guillen who was stabbed with a screw driver in Iloilo. Fifty-four lawyers in the Philippines have been killed due to work-related reasons under the Duterte administration, according to NUPL. Another lawyers’ group, the Free Legal Assistance Group, came out with its own study showing 61 lawyers have been killed since 2016 when Duterte took office, more than the number of lawyers killed in the previous 6 administrations combined. Lawyers and rights groups have warned red-tagging has dangerous consequences such as the killing of human rights lawyer Benjamin Ramos. FLAG member Raffy Aquino, also a UP Law alumnus, was falsely-tagged as an NPA member in a list posted on the website of the Armed Forces of the Philippines early this year.

       "  'content': 'MANILA (UPDATE) - The number of deaths due to self-harm increased by about a quarter in 2020, making suicide the 27th leading cause of death in the Philippines, recent data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed. Deaths due to suicide spiked to 3,529 last year, which is 25.7 percent higher compared to the 2,808 deaths due to self-harm in 2019, the PSA said in a statement released on March 16. The study covered deaths reported in the Philippines from January to December 2020, but has yet to account for Filipinos who died abroad, the PSA said. Earlier, experts said pandemic fatigue is affecting more Filipinos, endangering the general public’s mental health. This was evident in the increase of calls to helplines, fully-booked consultation schedules, and rise in activities that sought to combat stress. Psychologist Randy Dellosa said Filipinos have grown “sick and tired of trying to consider as a ‘new normal’ what in reality is an obvious ‘abnormal.’’ Estimates also showed some 3.6 million Filipinos suffered from mental health problems, but getting accurate numbers remained a challenge as access to healthcare professionals became more difficult during the pandemic. Based on the national prevalence study on mental, neurological and substance use disorders reported by National Mental Health Program by Frances Prescilla Cuevas, at least 1,145,871 people are suffering from depressive disorder. Up until October 6, the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) received around 32 to 37 calls since March 17, raising the monthly average calls to 907. Data from October onwards are unavailable as of posting. Despair was also palpable as over 420,000 Filipinos lost their jobs in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PSA divided COVID-19 deaths into 2 categories: those who succumbed to the virus, and those who were identified to be carriers of the disease after they died. \"COVID-19 with virus not identified was the seventh leading cause of death in the country with 19,800 cases or 3.4 percent of the total deaths in 2020,\" the study read. \"Registered deaths due to COVID-19 accounted for 8,200 or 1.4 percent of the total deaths in 2020, pushing its rank to number 16,\" it said. Deaths linked to road accidents decreased in 2020, the year when the government had to impose lockdowns and limit movement in Luzon and other parts of the country to curb the spread of COVID-19. Deaths due to transport accidents decreased to 8,000, a 37.4 percent drop compared to the 12,800 incidents in 2019, the PSA said. Assault-related deaths also declined by 32 percent in 2020, it said.

She said that while majority of the infections are happening at home, there is also an increasing percentage of workplace clusters. A graph shown by the health official showed incidence rates in cities with and without variants. Those with the more transmissible variants first detected in the United Kingdom and South Africa showed a higher attack rate or infection rate per 100,000 of the population. “Oo nakakacontribute talaga yung variants of concern sa mabilis na pagtaas ng kaso natin…(Pero) kahit wala tayong nakikita pang variant of concern sa maraming lugar sa Pilipinas talagang may pagtaas ng kaso dito,” De Guzman explained. (Yes, variants of concern really contribute to the faster increase of cases….But even in many areas in the Philippines without any detected variant of concern, there really is an increase in cases here.) De Guzman also showed data based on the Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Trends showing that there was an increase in mobility of people in the country starting December. While mobility peaked in December and immediately declined, an upward trend is seen.

Debold Sinas if an investigation shows he breached screening protocols in the province. \"For me, there\\'s no such thing as a VIP person, no VIP treatment for anybody. If he has violated the law, he should be held responsible,\" Dolor told ANC, when asked if Sinas was getting VIP treatment. The provincial government is looking into the possible liability of Sinas after he allegedly skipped health screening when he visited Calapan City on March 11, the same day he announced he was positive for COVID-19. \"Personally, I am not concerned whether he\\'s the chief of PNP or whether chief of military or whether he\\'s a government official. For as long as that person after investigation [was] found [to have violated the law], he should be held liable,\" Dolor said. The governor said they were waiting for official reports from the local government unit and local police before concluding the investigation. Sinas arrived in the province via helicopter, which Dolor said required coordination since health screenings were being conducted in the pier. There are no health personnel at the airport because there are no regular flights, he added. Dolor said local police officers who were exposed to Sinas had been quarantined and were scheduled to be tested for the virus. The country\\'s top cop went to the province for the ceremonial vaccination of medical workers of Mimaropa police. While Sinas was allowed to travel under the government\\'s relaxed COVID-19 measures, the PNP reportedly did not coordinate Sinas\\' arrival with the city government, Calapan City Mayor Arnan Panaligan had said. Sinas took a confirmatory swab test on March 9 ahead of his visit to Calapan City, which turned out negative, according to the mayor. The PNP chief underwent another swab test on March 11 for his visit to Palawan, which turned out positive, Panaligan added. \"If there is really no coordination with the city government upon the arrival, then this can be considered a breach of health protocol,\" Dolor said. \\'FALSE INFORMATION\\' In response to the incident, Mimaropa police director Brig. Gen. Pascual Muñoz maintained that Sinas complied with health protocols. \"Contrary to the circulating false information about the non- observance of the COVID-19 health protocols, PGEN DEBOLD M SINAS , Chief, PNP actually complied and accomplished more than what was required of him for his travel to Oriental Mindoro,\" he said in a statement released Sunday. Before arriving at the Calapan airport, Sinas filled out an online registration and received a confirmation message of his visit, which were the only requirements by the city government for authorized persons outside residence, Muñoz said. The police official added that Sinas underwent health screening from the medical team of the regional health service of Mimaropa police. Minimum health standards such as physical distancing were also observed during Sinas\\' visit, he added.\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\r\\n\"In these trying times, we are asking everyone to refrain from sharing any false information that may trigger hatred from the public,\" Muñoz said. \"Instead, we are enjoining everyone to pray for the health, safety and protection of everyone especially our dear CPNP, PGEN DEBOLD M SINAS and all the frontliners.\" Last year, Sinas, then a Metro Manila police director, was charged for allegedly violating health protocols for holding a \"mañanita\" or dawn serenade for his 55th birthday celebration.

In its daily situationer released on Tuesday, the Department of Health said there were 25,732 active COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila. The region also accounted for 2,842 in the new reported infections for the day. \"As of now, I don’t because the localized lockdowns are starting to yield positive outcomes,\" Duque told ANC\\'s Headstart when asked if he recommends that the capital region return to a stricter lockdown. Metro Manila as a whole is currently under general community quarantine, the second loosest lockdown level, but mayors have implemented restrictions in targeted areas within their constituencies. The region also observes a curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. and a ban on minors going outdoors. Duque said the granular lockdowns\\' effect will reflect in about 2 weeks, and \"if nothing changes and the cases continue to rise, then the possibility of a more widespread lockdown is certainly strong.\" \"Everything is possible, but we have to calibrate our response depending on the data that come in with the recommendation of our technical advisory group and our epidemiologist of the IATF…If they say that we need to have a more widespread lockdown, then we will recommend to the President,\" he said. One measure the government recently imposed is closing national borders to foreigners and returning Filipinos who are not overseas workers starting March 20. Duque said travel restrictions are \"temporary\" and are \"not there for long,\" as officials monitor the data on infection spikes closely. The Philippines has been tallying at least 4,000 daily additional COVID-19 cases in the past 5 days. According to monitoring by ABS-CBN Data Analytics, a similar trend occurred on Aug. 18-22 last year. The OCTA Research Group projected that if the current trend continues, new coronavirus cases in the Philippines can reach up to 11,000 daily. Dr. Beverly Lorraine Ho, director of Department of Health\\'s disease prevention and control bureau, said the rising number of added infections can be attributed to \"breaches in the health protocols,\" increased mobility, and the presence new coronavirus variants.

       "  'content': 'MANILA - A doctors\\' group on Wednesday urged the public not to drop their guard as the country battles a surge in COVID-19 infections. Dr. Maricar Limpin, vice president of Philippine College of Physicians, called for strict compliance of 4 minimum health standards -- wear face mask and face shield, observe physical distancing, and ensure proper ventilation. \"Huwag po tayong magsasawa kasi \\'pag tayo po ang magsawa, tayo po ang talo... We can\\'t afford to have such a thing as COVID fatigue,\" she told ANC. (We can\\'t get tired of doing these because if we do so, we will lose...) While her group is not calling for a \"time-out\" or stricter quarantine measure to curb fresh COVID-19 cases, the PCP recommends reducing transportation capacity and implementing staggered working hours. Limpin, who works at the Philippine Heart Center, said the surge was becoming serious with hospitals being filled with patients. \"We\\'re full. The ICU is full. The regular rooms are full. The emergency room is full. Nakapila \\'yong mga pasyente. (Patients are lining up.) I am working in a government hospital so we can\\'t really turn away our patients. So, we just have to accept them especially since most of our patients are with comorbidities,\" she said. On Monday, the Philippines recorded over 4,437 coronavirus infections, the fifth straight day that daily cases exceeded 4,000. Total cases have risen to 631,320, among Southeast Asia’s highest number of coronavirus tally. Death toll stood at 12,848. Data from Department of Health as of March 15 also showed that 19 health facilities in Metro Manila were considered at \"critical\" level or more than 85 percent of capacity occupied. Some 96 hospitals in the capital region are still at \"safe\" level or less than 60 percent are occupied, 15 are \"moderate\" or 60 to 70 percent are occupied and 20 are \"high risk\" or 70 to 85 percent are occupied.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'MANILA - Authorities are urged to extend COVID-19 measures such as curfew and barring of minors outside as 2 weeks might not be enough to curb virus transmission, the OCTA Research Group said Wednesday. Metro Manila mayors have imposed a 2-week curfew policy of 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. which began Monday. They have also prohibited minors from going outside for 2 weeks beginning Wednesday. Authorities, however, must still wait for data during the 2-week period, said OCTA Research fellow Guido David. \"Realistically, yung 2 weeks, speaking objectively, baka kulangin yun. On the safe side, syempre titingnan muna natin ano ‘yung datos. This week naman baka makita natin kung may slowing down effect,\" he told ABS-CBN\\'s Teleradyo.

Following the inoculation of healthcare workers, indigent senior citizens are next in line as they are most vulnerable to severe to critical COVID-19, according to Duque. \"We\\'re looking at 4,500 vaccination sites with each site vaccinating 100 individuals. So we’re looking at 450,000 vaccinees per day...as soon as the vaccines have come. Mga ganon (around), April,\" he told ANC\\'s Headstart.

Another 900,000 AstraZeneca jabs are set to arrive this month and 1.4 million more doses of Sinovac are set to arrive by the first week of April, Duque said. \"That should already suffice to complete the vaccination of the most prioritized group of healthcare workers.

       "  'content': 'MANILA — The spokesperson of the National Task Force Against COVID-19 clarified on Wednesday that minors are allowed to travel domestically with their families, contrary to his earlier announcement, amid a surge in new infections. Ret. Gen. Restituto Padilla said earlier Wednesday that only those aged 18 to 65 would be allowed to travel, in a bid to curb a recent surge in coronavirus infections. But hours after his announcement, Padilla said, \"I stand corrected.\" \"The NTF allows minors to travel with their families point to point. The only restriction is their movement within Metro Manila specially to malls and crowded areas consistent with the announcement of the MMDA,\" he said in a text message. \"They may also avail of domestic air travel with their families specially during the season of lent and their academic break,\" he added. Metro Manila from Wednesday banned minors outside their residences as new daily COVID-19 infections surged to levels similar to the early months of the pandemic crisis last year. The inter-agency task force leading the country\\'s pandemic response has yet to discuss whether or not to ban domestic travel of minors, said Tourism Secretary Berna Romulo-Puyat. Romulo-Puyat said she only learned of Padilla\\'s previous announcement after some social media users asked her if they may not bring along minors on tourist trips. Tourism has reopened in areas under modified general community quarantine, the loosest of 4 lockdown levels. These areas include Boracay and Palawan, she said. Metro Manila, the epicenter of the outbreak, is under general community quarantine, but several measures have been put in place to arrest the fresh surge, including a curfew, liquor ban, and limits on flight arrivals, among others. \"Makikiusap kami. We will give our stand sa IATF but we will follow what the majority thinks. But the fact na MGCQ, pwede na tourism. Kailangan lang sumunod sa health and safety protocols,\" Romulo-Puyat told ABS-CBN News. (We will appeal. We will give our stand to the IATF, but we will follow what the majority thinks. But the fact that is in MGCQ, tourism is allowed. Health and safety protocols should just be followed. ) \"DOT will push pa rin lalo na this is the time to spend with families. Although we understand na tumataas ang cases, kami sa DOT, we are always for balancing slow but sure [reopening], but at the same time health and safety is there,\" she added.

       "  'content': 'MANILA — Amid the “furor” surrounding the deaths of 9 activists on “Bloody Sunday,” Supreme Court magistrates on Tuesday said they are considering a proposal requiring law enforcers to wear body cameras to prevent abuses in the service of warrants. “The Court today considered a proposal to require the use of body cameras for law enforcers who will execute warrants to be issued by the trial courts. A Resolution will be drafted which will be further considered soonest,” Supreme Court spokesperson Brian Keith Hosaka said in a statement. Sources from the high court said SC justices had a “long conversation” about the issue during their weekly en banc session. The proposal was “unilateral” or based on the initiative of some justices, meaning, there were no parties who filed any requests regarding the proposed measure. Human rights lawyers have previously called on the Supreme Court to review the rules on the issuance and implementation of search warrants after simultaneous raids in Batangas, Cavite and Rizal ended up in the killing of 9 activists. One of the sources confirmed to ABS-CBN News that the discussion on the use of body cameras was “related to the furor over [the] implementation by police of warrants that have resulted in deaths.” RELATIVES, WITNESSES CONTEST POLICE VERSION Police have claimed that in all 9 instances, the activists supposedly fought back and resisted arrest. As evidence, police presented guns, ammunitions and grenades supposedly recovered from the possession of the deceased. But relatives and witnesses have contested the police’s version of the events. The mothers of couple Ariel Evangelista and Chai Lemita-Evangelista said the couple were handcuffed, dragged away from the cottage they were staying in and brought to a nearby house where they were later shot, based on what Ariel’s 10-year-old child saw. The lawyer of Bayan Cavite coordinator Manny Asuncion said there was no service of search warrant. Law enforcers allegedly barged into his office and brought Asuncion into a room where he was killed. Relatives of Puroy dela Cruz, a member of the Dumagat tribe, who was killed in his house in a remote village in Tanay, Rizal pointed out there could not have been a shootout since they were surrounded by dozens of uniformed and armed policemen. They also pointed out, if dela Cruz fought back, why were bullet holes found only on one side of his house? Relatives also denied the activists killed and even those arrested owned guns, ammunition or explosives. The daughter of 61-year-old paralegal Nimfa Lanzanas, who is currently detained after being charged with illegal possession of firearms and explosives, said it would have been impossible for her elderly mother to keep dangerous firearms and explosives in a house with 3 minors. The PNP earlier rejected allegations policemen resorted to planting of evidence. But questions surrounding the proper implementation of search warrants had long been raised, most recently with the arrest of journalist Lady Ann Salem and 6 trade unionists on International Human Rights Day last year. Salem and her companion Rodrigo Esparago were later cleared of illegal possession of firearms and explosives after a Mandaluyong court voided the search warrant against them for being “vague.” Police confiscated cellphones and laptops not specified in the search warrant, in what the court described as a “fishing expedition.” Activists and rights groups have claimed the Philippine government is “weaponizing” search warrants against alleged communist rebels, urging the Supreme Court to review the rules on search warrants to prevent further bloodshed. SUPREME COURT RESPONSE In the wake of the killings, Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta directed Court Administrator Midas Marquez to submit a report surrounding the issuance of the search warrants used on “Bloody Sunday.” In his report, Marquez said the PNP applied for a total of 72 search warrants before the Manila and Antipolo regional trial courts a few days before “Bloody Sunday,” of which 46 search warrants were issued after 2 days of hearings. But he stressed: “…the issuance of the search warrants by the judges and their judges and their service or implementation by the law enforcers are two (2) different acts.” Last week, chief justice nominee SC Associate Justice Ramon Paul Hernando also sought to defend judges who issued search warrants according to the rules, during his interview with the Judicial and Bar Council. “If he really issued it on the basis of what our rules required, I think the judge should not be blamed for that. It’s a different thing when it comes to the implementation of the search warrant,” he said. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra, for his part, did not discount the possibility of abuses in the service of search warrants. “Kung minsan, may tendency na gumamit ng unnecessary force ang mga nag-eenforce o nagseserve ng search warrants kaya nandoon ang problema,” he said. “All we need to do is for people affected to bring it to the attention of the proper authorities concerned so that the proper administrative and necessary criminal sanctions can be imposed,” he said. BODY CAMERAS The Philippine National Police had previously entertained the issue of using body cameras during police operations following the thousands of suspects killed in drug operations. That proposal had languished for years since it was proposed in 2017. It is not immediately clear how the PNP will comply should the Supreme Court decide to require the use of body cameras in the implementation of warrants.'},\n",

       "  'content': 'MAYNILA - Nagsimula na ang apat na araw na lockdown sa mga idineklarang critical zone sa Maynila dahil sa mataas na kaso ng COVID-19. Anim na barangay ang naka-lockdown mula hatinggabi ng Miyerkoles hanggang Sabado. Kabilang sa mga naka-barangay lockdown ang Barangay 185 sa Tondo, Barangay 374 sa Sta. Cruz, Barangay 521 sa Sampaloc, Barangay 628 sa Sta. Mesa, Barangay 675 sa Paco at Barangay 847 sa Pandacan. Pare-parehas na nakapagtala ang mga naturang barangay ng higit 10 active cases ng COVID-19. Kapansin-pansin din na karamihan sa mga nagpopositibo ay pami-pamilya. Sa Barangay 521, magkakamag-anak at nakatira sa iisang street ang 12 kaso, ayon kay chairman Santiago Calizo. Mahigpit ang pagbabantay sa ini-lockdown na barangay lalo’t may mga nagpositibo na naka-quarantine pa rito. Ayon kay Calizo, nakiusap ang pamilya na huwag silang dalhin sa quarantine facility dahil may mga bata silang kasama at natatakot silang lumala pa ang kanilang kalagayan kung maisama sa ibang COVID-positive. Inaasahan maisailalim sa swab test ang iba pa nilang kasama sa compound maging ang mga taga-barangay mismo. Isang barangay official kasi ang nagpositibo rin sa COVID-19 at naka-quarantine sa kaniyang bahay. Sa ngayon, nasa 59% ang bed capacity ng mga quarantine facility sa Maynila. Nasa 13 ang quarantine facilities sa lungsod pero tatlo rito ang hindi ginagamit dahil sa pagkukumpuni ng mga ito. Sa 10 quarantine facility na nagagamit, anim dito ang higit 80% na ang occupancy at hindi na tataas sa pito\\r\\nang bed capacity. Kaya para mapigilan ang pagkalat ng virus, muling nakakulong sa kanilang mga bahay ang mga residente at bawal munang lumabas. Sa Tondo, may apat na inaresto sa paglabag sa quarantine matapos mahuling nag-iinuman sa tabi ng riles. Isasailalim sila sa swab testing at isasailalim sa quarantine habang hinihintay ang resulta.'}]"
