This as the administration saw a shutdown of a major broadcast network and arrests, prosecution and red tagging of journalists. The survey, conducted from Nov. 21 to 25 last year, also found that less than a fifth (16 percent) of Filipinos disagreed with the statement: “It is dangerous to print or broadcast anything critical of the administration, even if it is the truth.\" Meanwhile, 18 percent were undecided. The responses have a net agreement score of +49, considered by the pollster as \"strong.\" >EMBED CHART 1 HERE This net score increased by 28 points from the +21 reported in July 2020 which was \"moderate,\" it pointed out. Such sentiment was most prevalent in Mindanao, with a net agreement of +58. It was followed by Visayas with +55, Balance Luzon with +47, and Metro Manila with +30. Compared to the July 2020 poll, SWS said the net agreement \"rose sharply\" in Mindanao and in Visayas. The net agreement also increased in Balance Luzon and in Metro Manila. Belief that critical reporting on the Duterte administration is dangerous rose to +58 from +28 in Mindanao, and +55 from +26 in Visayas. It also rose from +16 to +47 in Balance Luzon and from +16 to +30 in Metro Manila. The release of the survey came almost a year since media network ABS-CBN was forced off the air after its franchise expiry— a promise Duterte had made in public speeches. Lawmakers from the House of Representatives eventually rejected its bid for a franchise renewal. Thousands have lost their jobs in the process amid the pandemic as the company\\'s regional stations were also closed. Malacañang earlier rejected notions that the ABS-CBN shutdown was linked to Duterte\\'s previous threats to the company, which has been airing critical news against the administration. RELATED VIDEO: FREEDOM OF SPEECH Some 65 percent of the 1,500 respondents interviewed by the pollster face-to-face, on the other hand, believe that they could \"say anything I want, openly and without fear, even if it is against the\\r\\nadministration.\" Nineteen percent disagreed with the statement while 16 percent were undecided, results from the survey showed. The net agreement score on the sentiment stood at +46, the SWS said, which was also considered as \"strong.\" The net score this year, the SWS pointed out, increased by 5 points from the +41 in June 2019. \"This is the highest since the strong +48 in January 2001,\" SWS noted. Belief that a person can say whatever he wants openly and fearlessly even if against the administration was highest in the Visayas with a net score of +59, followed by Mindanao with +55, and Balance Luzon with +42. Net agreement was lowest among respondents in Metro Manila with a score of +28. Comparing it with the results from the same poll released in June 2019, net agreement rose from \"strong to very strong\" in Visayas and in Mindanao, up by 12 points and 23 points respectively. The net agreement was maintained in Balance Luzon but it fell in Metro Manila by 17 points, according to the survey.

Bullock saved the Knicks from completely collapsing after they blew a 16-point, third-quarter lead and trailed by five points twice in the fourth. The Knicks held a 94-90 lead after Alec Burks hit a floater in the lane with 31.5 seconds left but Orlando drew within 94-93 on Evan Fournier's 3-pointer with 27.6 seconds left. The Knicks had a chance to clinch the win but Bullock got tied up by Fournier and lost a jump ball with 19.5 seconds left. After Orlando called a timeout, Aaron Gordon inbounded to Fournier, who moved around a screen by Nikola Vucevic but Bullock trailed Fournier and came up with the clutch steal beyond the 3-point line. Burks led the Knicks with 21 points and also added 10 assists. Julius Randle posted his third triple-double of the season with 18 points, a career-high 17 assists and 10 rebounds as the Knicks shot 43 percent and bounced back from close losses to Brooklyn and Philadelphia. Fournier scored 23 points for Orlando, which lost its ninth straight game. Gordon and Vucevic added 17 apiece for the Magic, who shot 42.7 percent After allowing the game's first five points, the Magic took a 20-10 lead on Fournier's one-legged 3-pointer with 5:50 left in the first quarter. New York outscored Orlando, 14-6, the rest of the frame to get within 26-24 after 12 minutes, before taking a 45-44 lead by intermission. Randle's 3-pointer put New York up 72-56 with 1:59 left in the third but Orlando scored the final 10 points of the quarter and got within 72-66 after Khem Birch hit a bank shot with one second left. Orlando regained the lead when Fournier's 3-pointer made it 75-74 with 9:54 left in the fourth. Orlando took its second five-point lead of the fourth at 87-82 on Vucevic's 14-footer with 5:15 left but the Knicks took an 88-87 lead on Frank Ntilikina's 3-pointer with 3:49 remaining. Randle then hit two jumpers to give the Knicks a 92-87 edge with 2:39 left. Orlando had a chance to retake the lead when Bullock missed a 3-pointer with 56.4 seconds left in the third but Dwayne Bacon missed a wide-open 3-pointer with 44.7 seconds to go.\"},\n",

Bogdanovic was 9-for-14 from the floor and made five 3-pointers in the victory. It was only his second double-digit game since returning on March 2 from an avulsion fracture in his right knee that cost him 25 games. He added six rebounds and three assists. It marked the first time the Hawks have had a seven-game winning streak since 2017 and kept Nate McMillan's record perfect since he became head coach on March 1. The victory broke a two-game losing streak to the Thunder and avenged a 118-109 defeat suffered in Oklahoma City on Feb. 26. Atlanta also got 23 points and nine assists from Trae Young, who was rested during the fourth quarter, and 19 points and three blocks from John Collins. Oklahoma City got 19 points from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Reserve Ty Jerome made a season-high six 3-pointers to finish with 18 points. The Thunder got Lu Dort back in the lineup after missing two games with a sprained big toe and Al Horford played again after being rested for two games. Horford scored 11 and Dort added eight. The team was without Darius Bazley (left shoulder) for the fifth straight game. The Hawks came out hot from the floor, made 11 of their first 17 shots, and took a 25-8 lead on Bogdanovic's 3-pointer.

Jaworski, best known for his role as Barangay Ginebra\\'s feisty playing coach in the \\'80s and early \\'90s, had just turned 75 last March 8. \"Last year, he was hospitalized due to a bout with pneumonia. He, however, tested negative for COVID-19. Due to a non-life threatening blood abnormality that was discovered by his doctors in 2016, former senator Jaworski has experienced difficulty in regaining strength, weight and normal well-being,\" said the family. \"Despite this, his is making good progress and is slowly moving forward.\" No local basketball player has caught the imagination of Filipino fans more than Jaworski. It was the \"Big J,\" who first instilled the \"never say die\" spirit in Ginebra, a phenomenon very much alive in the Gin Kings up to this day. Jaworski recently topped the latest list of the 10 outstanding athletes, together with the late Fil-Spanish footballer Paulino Alcantara, who will be enshrined next month in the Philippine Sports Hall of Fame.

There is no government official who has access to these funds, said Palace spokesman Harry Roque. “Mula pagbili o procurement hanggang sa pagbayad ng mga bakuna ay ima-manage ng ating multilateral partners. Ibig sabihin po, bagamat tayo’y binigyan ng kumbaga, credit line, iyong pag-draw down po sa credit line para sa pagbili ng bakuna, didiretso po ‘yan sa vaccine manufacturer,” Roque said in a press briefing. (From procurement to payment of the vaccines, these are managed by our multilateral partners. That mean that even if we were granted credit line, drawing down this credit line for the procurement of vaccines will go straight to vaccine manufacturers.) “Hindi po dapat magtanong na sa kabila ng mga nautang na salapi e nasaan ang bakuna. Meron lang tayong approved loans at iyong mga proceeds po ng mga loans, diretsong ibabayad ‘yan sa vaccine manufacturers,” he added (We should not ask where the vaccines are despite our loans. We have approved loans and the proceeds of these loans will go straight to vaccine manufacturers.) The Philippines has so far secured 600,000 China-donated COVID-19 shots from Beijing-based Sinovac Biotech, and 525,600 doses of Britain\\'s AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine through the COVAX Facility. Authorities expect to receive 1.4 million more Sinovac doses in March, and about 900,000 AstraZeneca doses this month or in early April, said the country\\'s vaccine \"czar\" Secretary Carlito Galvez.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier this week recommended that all of the doses be used as the first shot, instead of setting aside some of these for the second shot for health workers. The time interval for administering the second dose of AstraZeneca is 3 months from the first jab. This means the country would have enough time to get another shipment of AstraZeneca doses from vaccine-sharing COVAX Facility for the second jab, Duque told Duterte in a taped meeting on Monday. \"The President has approved the request to utilize all COVAX-donated AstraZeneca vaccine doses as first-dose vaccination in order to protect a larger number of frontline healthcare workers in areas witnessing increased transmission,\" said Duterte\\'s spokesman Harry Roque.

In a decision dated March 9, the PCC found that the deal does not result in substantial lessening of competition, it said in a statement. The transaction \"results in a creation of a new market that is conventionally pro-competition,\" the PCC said. “The transaction is a new area of investment formed for the creation of a residential and commercial real estate development project. This will expand the existing market and likely create an opportunity for the emergence of new markets for commercial and residential real estate within the City of Manila,” the decision read. The joint venture was established for the \"Manila Waterfront City\" reclamation project, with the Manila LGU holding 51 percent of the arrangement and Manila Waterfront with 49 percent, the PCC said. Manila Waterfront City is a raw land reclamation and development project covering 318 hectares of foreshore and offshore areas in Manila, the agency said. A central business district, a gateway, a marina, a waterfront, entertainment, health and education hubs will be built in the said development, the PCC said.

Wala akong pain, wala akong sakit, kung bakit nangyari sa amin \\'yon. Kasi ang kapalit nun ay mas naging close ang buong pamilya. May magandang kapalit \\'yon. Nagkaroon ako ng takot, yes. Para kay Chubby and kay Gela, kay Arjo, kay Ria na mahawa, lalo na \\'yung bunso. Kasi at that time walang puwedeng sumama (na hindi) COVID-positive sa loob ng hospital. Natakot ako roon para sa bunso talaga,\" ani Sanchez. Giit ng aktres, maraming biyaya ang dumating sa kanyang buhay mula nang gumaling sila sa COVID-19. \"Sumatutal walang negative kahit ano na nangyari sa buhay ko last year kasi ang kapalit nun blessings. Ang dami-daming nangyaring magaganda sa buhay ko after nun. So papaano ko kukuwestiyunan \\'yung isang beses na nagka-COVID kami, na thank God nalagpasan namin, kumpara doon sa binigay naman Niya after? Sabi ko nga, lahat tayo, karamihan sa atin may kuwestiyon, bakit Lord, bakit ganun?\\' Pero darating \\'yung time na \\'yung mga katanungan natin masasagot din \\'yan later on. \\'Di natin alam kung kailanman, basta darating ang kasagutan sa tanong natin na \\'yon,” dagdag ni Sanchez. Ayon kay Sanchez, isang malaking biyaya niyang maituturing ang dami rin ng mga taong nagdasal para sa kanyang panggaling. “Noong time na nagka-COVID ako, ang dami-dami nagdadasal. Tapos nagugulat ako na hindi ko mga kilala \\'yung iba, nag-te-text, may nagpapa-text. \\'Di ba blessing \\'yon? Ni minsan hindi ako nagsalita na \\'bakit, Lord?\\' ...Never naman ako iniwan ng Diyos. Ako ang nang-iwan sa Diyos. Tini-take for granted ko Siya. Maraming beses.

Nandiyan lang Siya, naghihintay lang Siya kung kailan natin Siya tawagin siya at kailan natin siya i-embrace totally sa buhay,” ani Sanchez.
