Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier this week recommended that all of the doses be used as the first shot, instead of setting aside some of these for the second shot for health workers. The time interval for administering the second dose of AstraZeneca is 3 months from the first jab.

The transaction \"results in a creation of a new market that is conventionally pro-competition,\" the PCC said. “The transaction is a new area of investment formed for the creation of a residential and commercial real estate development project. This will expand the existing market and likely create an opportunity for the emergence of new markets for commercial and residential real estate within the City of Manila,” the decision read.

Manila Waterfront City is a raw land reclamation and development project covering 318 hectares of foreshore and offshore areas in Manila, the agency said.

       "  'content': 'MAYNILA -- Muling binalikan ng aktres na si Sylvia Sanchez ang naging karanasan na sumubok sa tatag ng kanyang pananalig sa Diyos. Noong nakaraang taon, nagpositibo sa coronavirus si Sanchez at kanyang mister na si Art Atayde. Sa media conference para sa pinakabagong serye ng ABS-CBN na \"Huwag Kang Mangamba\" kung saan isa si Sanchez sa mga bituin, sinabi ng aktres na mas naging matatag ang kanilang pamilya dahil dito. \"Honestly, sa totoo lang, wala akong kuwestiyon kay Lord bakit nangyari sa akin \\'yon. Wala akong pain, wala akong sakit, kung bakit nangyari sa amin \\'yon. Kasi ang kapalit nun ay mas naging close ang buong pamilya. May magandang kapalit \\'yon. Nagkaroon ako ng takot, yes. Para kay Chubby and kay Gela, kay Arjo, kay Ria na mahawa, lalo na \\'yung bunso. Kasi at that time walang puwedeng sumama (na hindi) COVID-positive sa loob ng hospital. Natakot ako roon para sa bunso talaga,\" ani Sanchez. Giit ng aktres, maraming biyaya ang dumating sa kanyang buhay mula nang gumaling sila sa COVID-19. \"Sumatutal walang negative kahit ano na nangyari sa buhay ko last year kasi ang kapalit nun blessings. Ang dami-daming nangyaring magaganda sa buhay ko after nun. So papaano ko kukuwestiyunan \\'yung isang beses na nagka-COVID kami, na thank God nalagpasan namin, kumpara doon sa binigay naman Niya after? Sabi ko nga, lahat tayo, karamihan sa atin may kuwestiyon, bakit Lord, bakit ganun?\\' Pero darating \\'yung time na \\'yung mga katanungan natin masasagot din \\'yan later on. \\'Di natin alam kung kailanman, basta darating ang kasagutan sa tanong natin na \\'yon,” dagdag ni Sanchez. Ayon kay Sanchez, isang malaking biyaya niyang maituturing ang dami rin ng mga taong nagdasal para sa kanyang panggaling. “Noong time na nagka-COVID ako, ang dami-dami nagdadasal. Tapos nagugulat ako na hindi ko mga kilala \\'yung iba, nag-te-text, may nagpapa-text. \\'Di ba blessing \\'yon? Ni minsan hindi ako nagsalita na \\'bakit, Lord?\\' ...Never naman ako iniwan ng Diyos. Ako ang nang-iwan sa Diyos. Tini-take for granted ko Siya. Maraming beses. Pero Siya tuloy-tuloy niya akong niyayakap. Never naman nang-iwan ang Diyos sa atin. Nandiyan lang Siya, naghihintay lang Siya kung kailan natin Siya tawagin siya at kailan natin siya i-embrace totally sa buhay,” ani Sanchez. Sa Lunes, Marso 22, magsisimula na ang pagpapalabas sa inaabangang serye na \"Huwag Kang Mangamba\" na pinagbibidahan nina Andrea Brillantes, Francine Diaz, Seth Fedelin at Kyle Echarri.

       "  'content': 'A Hong Kong woman on trial for murdering her five-year-old stepdaughter was mentally sound despite feeling so stressed by childcare she “hated” the girl, a court heard on Thursday. “She didn’t look depressed to me,” psychiatrist Dr Amy Liu testified in the High Court, referring to her interview with the mother a week after the defendant’s arrest in January 2018. “She was not tearful. She was actually quite polite and very calm. She was not diagnosed with any formal kind of psychiatric illness.” Liu, a consultant at Castle Peak Hospital, said she interviewed the mother, now 30, on four more occasions, during which she reported suffering from a low mood as a result of stress from childcare and her first experience of managing such a large household. But the expert found these symptoms were not pervasive or severe enough to warrant a diagnosis, because they were reactive to stress and not as generalised as one would expect of depression, which affects the person as a whole, given its nature as a biological illness involving an imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain. That finding was supported by the fact the mother did not require any medical attention in the three years between her arrest and trial, as well as a five-month record of more than 15,000 messages with her husband and a friend, which offered an insight into her overall mood and motivation to connect with others. In particular, Liu noted the mother’s irritability and claim of impaired judgment was specifically directed to the deceased and her eight-year-old stepson, without any impact on her loving relationship with her husband and biological daughter, then aged seven. “You won’t just be irritable towards two people,” the prosecution witness said. “This is not mental illness, it’s just human nature – and if it’s human nature, it’s an issue for the jury.” The stepmother and the children’s 29-year-old father have admitted to child cruelty inflicted upon the deceased and her brother over 150 days from August 10, 2017, but denied murdering the girl, who died of septicaemia on the following January 6. Prosecutors said the couple had indirectly but significantly contributed to the child’s death because their prolonged abuse and neglect had considerably weakened her immune system and ability to fight the bacterial infection that ultimately killed her. The High Court heard both defendants had sought to plead guilty to manslaughter – a bid rejected by the prosecution – with the mother contending she was suffering from a recurrent depressive disorder at the material time. Liu’s expert report revealed the stepmother’s account of her childhood, from being a single child having a poor relationship with her father and experiencing her parents’ divorce at about age 16, to being raped twice in her teenage years, going through an abortion with her then husband, and a divorce in 2015. The woman then met her current husband on WeChat in February 2016, moved in with his family the following September and tied the knot two months later. She also told the psychiatrist she had a bad relationship with her husband’s family and it was decided that they should move in with her mother, which took place on August 10, 2017. A month later, she started to hit her stepchildren, first on their palms, then with a rattan stick on their buttocks and soles, because the boy told lies while the girl exhibited poor self-care and did not respond to her, the report said. She added that her husband was also involved in hitting the children, claiming he was responsible for 60 to 70 per cent of the beatings and that he was more forceful as he would also throw punches. She further admitted to the psychiatrist she had tied up the children to stop them from picking their scars, and had arranged for their absences to prevent the school from seeing the beating marks. On Thursday, her defence counsel Caesar Lo said her childhood experiences “might have sowed the seed for future psychological illness”, and she was depressed at the material time, with symptoms such as sleeping problems, headaches, and feelings of helplessness and desperation, as reflected by her WeChat and WhatsApp messages. “At first I was truly fond of them,” she texted her friend on December 5. “Now I find them annoying from the bottom of my heart … I don’t even want to talk to them. I’m under a lot of stress.” A week later she said: “It’s better when the two elder ones return from school – once it’s just the two of us, I really want to die. “Sometimes I see the injuries I couldn’t bear it,” she continued on December 11. “But once [the child] starts talking, making noises, nagging, I feel so much hate. But I don’t think I would hit [the child] again, I’ve [reached the point of] scaring myself, even when [the child] isn’t afraid.” Later she texted the same friend: “I kind of want to strangle myself to death. The family of six can burn charcoal together. Quick and easy.” The psychiatrist, however, maintained under cross-examination that these messages were not indicative of depression or adjustment disorder, as she found the mother was just expressing her emotions in a transient moment, without any actual plan to commit suicide. Liu added the woman had specifically denied having recurrent suicidal thoughts. The children’s 56-year-old step-grandmother also denied four counts of child cruelty. None of the defendants or their relatives can be identified due to a gag order from Mr Justice Albert Wong Sung-hau, aimed at protecting the identities of the children. The jury trial continues on Friday.'},\n",

(All Filipino citizens, whether returning overseas Filipinos or overseas Filipino workers, are allowed to return to the Philippines.) National Task Force on COVID-19 spokesman Restituto Padilla, meanwhile, urged overseas Filipinos to put off their plans to fly home to support containment efforts. “Maganda po check niyo website ng Bureau of Immigration pero kung pwede pa kayong manatili kasama ang inyong anak at hindi naman kayo nagmamadaling umuwi, ang ating abiso ay ipagpaliban n’yo na lang po \\'yung pagbiyahe para makatulong sa ginagawa nating hakbang para mapigilan \\'yung pagpasok ng new variants,” sabi ni Padilla,\" he said in a TeleRadyo interview. (It\\'s good if you can check the Bureau of Immigration website but if you and your children are not in a hurry to come home, our advice is to postpone your plans so you can help in our efforts to prevent the entry of new variants.) The coronavirus task force said earlier this week that foreign citizens and returning nationals who have not been working overseas will not be able to enter the country from March 20 until April 19. Roque said foreigners would still be barred from entering the country effective March 22, 12:01 a.m. until April 21, 11:59 p.m. Exceptions to the rule include diplomats, members of international organizations and their dependents, foreigners involved in medical repatriation, foreign seafarers under green lane programs for crew change, foreign spouses and children of Filipinos traveling with them, and emergency or humanitarian cases, said Roque. The Civil Aeronautics Board on Tuesday capped passenger arrivals at Manila\\'s international airport to a maximum of 1,500 per day from March 18 to April 19 to help contain the spread of COVID-19, which has infected 640,984 people in the Philippines. — With a report from Reuters'},\n",

Ito\\'y matapos bawiin ng gobyerno ang kautusan na mga overseas Filipino workers lamang ang maaaring pumasok sa bansa sa loob ng isang buwan dahil sa pagsirit ng mga kaso. Sa paglilinaw Biyernes, sinabing lahat ng Pilipino mula ibang bansa ay maaari nang pumasok, pero hanggang 1,500 lang kada araw ang pwedeng tanggapin. “Sa mga Pilipinong pauwi, kung ‘di na maiiwasan na kailangan kayong umuwi, \\'yan po ay mapapasailalim na sa poder ng Commissioner of Immigration na maaring payagan o hindi basta sang-ayon doon sa mga lumabas na mga orders,” sabi ni NTF spokesman Restituto Padilla. Sa panayam sa TeleRadyo nitong Biyernes, inabisuhan din niya ang mga papauwi sa bansa na mag-check din muna sa website ng Bureau of Immigration. “Maganda po check niyo website ng Bureau of Immigration pero kung pwede pa kayong manatili kasama ang inyong anak at hindi naman kayo nagmamadaling umuwi, ang ating abiso ay ipagpaliban n’yo na lang po \\'yung pagbiyahe para makatulong sa ginagawa nating hakbang para mapigilan \\'yung pagpasok ng new variants,” sabi ni Padilla. Wala naman aniyang makakapigil sa mga Pilipinong nais na umuwi ng bansa basta’t ito aniya ay naaayon sa ipinatutupad na protocols ng immigration. Pansamantalang isasara ng Pilipinas ang borders nito sa mga dayuhan simula Marso 22 hanggang Abril 21, bilang isa sa mga tugon sa biglang pagtaas ng bilang ng mga kaso ng COVID-19 at ang pagdami na rin ng impeksiyong dulot ng mga bagong variant. Sa ilalim ng kautusan, maaari namang pumasok ang mga seaman, kabilang ang mga dayuhan na may seafarer\\'s visa. \"Ang panibagong revision doon sa unang inilabas na guidelines ay ang pagpapahintulot ngayon sa lahat ng mga maglalayag, Pilipino man o foreigner basta may hawak na seafarer\\'s visa. Pwede na silang magpatuloy ng kanilang biyahe papuntang Pilipinas basta ito ay kasama sa kanilang gagawin na crew change na tinatawag sa green lane na protocol na ating isinaad at ginawa noong nakaraang taon para patuloy ang pagpapalitan ng mga tao, o crew ng isang barko,” paliwanag niya. Naisama rin aniya sa revision ang exemption sa lahat ng mga asawa o anak ng mga Pilipino na kasama nilang bumibiyahe pabalik ng bansa basta mayroon silang valid visa. “Wala pa ring pagbabago sa foreign nationals. Nakalagay pa rin sa guidelines na maliban lang sa medical emergencies na endorso ng DFA at ng OWWA, wala pang foreign national na maaring pumunta dito maliban lang kung sila ay asawa o anak ng isang Pilipinong pabalik na po dito at may hawak na valid na visa,” saad niya. Kasama din sa memo ang pagkakaroon ng 1,500 kada araw na limit para sa international inbound passengers sa Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Nitong Huwebes, nakapagtala ang Pilipinas ng kabuuang 640,984 na kaso ng COVID-19, kabilang na ang higit 66,000 active cases. “Ang pinakamainam na panangga natin sa pagkakaroon ng COVID-19 ay ang striktong pagsunod pa rin sa health protocols, maging nandito tayo sa Pilipinas, sa ibang bansa, o habang nagbibiyahe,” sabi ni Padilla. - TeleRadyo 19 Marso 2021'},\n",

The Sy family confirmed the death of Jan Catherine, daughter of Henry \"Big Boy\" Sy. Jr, on Thursday. Sy Jr. is chairman of SM Prime Holdings. COVID-19, hepatitis, dengue and malaria had been ruled out by doctors, the family said in a statement shared with relatives and friends when the young woman was still in critical condition in a hospital. \"They are still not sure what this is, but the highest possibility is that it is bacterial infection that resulted in leptospirosis. This is possible if even a small cut that can go unnoticed is made,\" they said. Sy\\'s condition showed \"no signs of a disease\" or virus brewing. She was \"young and strong,\" the family had said. Before she passed away, Sy was put on 3 strong antibiotics to try to kill the bacteria, and she was also given steroids, the family shared.
